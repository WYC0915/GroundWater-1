<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</b>
<p>
The program SATGRA displays the contents of a Bernese observation
file using an ASCII character pseudo graphics.
<br>
The vertical axis of the plot contains the list of PRN numbers for the
satellites together with the frequency and the total number of observations for
the particular satellite. The horizontal axis is the time axis (unit: epoch
numbers) exactly covering the length of the file or an user specified time
window. The time period in which the receiver tracked each
satellite is represented on the specific satellite lines: '<tt>*</tt>' for
valid observations, '-' for marked observations, or '&nbsp;' for no
observations within the time bin.

<a name="REPOSSUM" default=""></a>
<p><b>RESULT FILE</b>
<p><b>Repositioning summary:</b>
If the "Satellite problems" file indicates a repositioning event for a
satellite within the time interval that is plotted a repositioning
summary file may be generated. It contains an extraction of the graphic
from all selected observation files for the maneuver satellite. Usually
one character corresponds to one epoch. So ,the time interval plotted before
and after the repositioning event depends on the "Number of characters"
selected for the width of the plot in the "DISPLAY OPTIONS".

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If no repositioning event is indicated for one of
the observed satellites or no satellite problem file was specified an
existing repositioning summary file with the specified name is deleted.
The existence of this file may be used as an indicator for a repositioning
event.

<a name="SYSOUT"  default="SATGRA"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<p><b>SATGRA 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="CONST" default="CONST."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>General constants:</b>
This file contains all the physical and astronomical constants used
in the Bernese GNSS Software. Most probably you will never have to
modify this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">$X/GEN/CONST.</a>

<a name="SATELL" default="SATELLIT.I08"></a>
<p><b>Satellite information:</b>
This file contains general information on GNSS (and LEO/GEO) satellites.
For the session to be processed,
each satellite has to appear once in this file
within a corresponding time window.

<p><i>Note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08 is maintained by AIUB/CODE.
It includes a complete history concerning the GPS satellite constellation
(and newly launched satellites are regularly added).
You can get the latest version of this file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08</a>

<a name="SATCRUX" default="SAT_$Y+0"></a>
<p><b>Satellite problems:</b>
This file contains information on satellite problems concerning modeling.
The program SATGRA uses only the information on the (mean) epochs of GPS
repositioning events. If an entry is found for the time interval to display
for at least one of the observed satellites a special repositioning section
is added to the program output or in addition a repositioning summary file
can be generated.

<p><i>Note:</i>
Corresponding year-specific files are maintained by AIUB/CODE.
You can get the latest version of the current file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/SAT_2003.CRX">$X/GEN/SAT_2003.CRX</a>

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>SAT_$Y+0</tt>

<p><b>SATGRA 2.1: Display Options</b>

<a name="TITLE" default="">
<p><b>TITLE</b></a>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment in the program output
to document the program run. The title should characterize the program run by,
e.g., giving the most important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="FREQ" default="L3"></a>
<p><b>DISPLAY OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Frequency:</b>
Whenever L1 (option <b>L1</b>), L2 (option <b>L2</b>), or L1 and L2 (option
<b>L3</b>) data from a satellite have been collected, a '<tt>*</tt>' is placed in the
appropriate place of the plot. To indicate a reasonable number of marked
observations a '-' is used instead.
Option <b>L1&amp;L2</b> will produce a separate line for L1 and L2
data. The numbers along the horizontal axis are epoch numbers
whenever the scenario changes.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>L3</tt>

<a name="NCHAR" default="255"></a>
<p><b>Number of characters:</b>
You can select the width of the plot, depending on the screen used for the
requested resolution. The width of an individual character will be adapted
accordingly. A maximum of 255 characters is allowed.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>255</tt>

<a name="PLOTAMB" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Plot ambiguities:</b>
If you check this box, an 'A' is placed in the appropriate location
of the plot for each phase ambiguity. If the ambiguity was resolved to
its integer value in a single difference phase observation file a lower
case 'a' is written instead. The option has no effect for
code observation files.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked for phase observation files

<a name="STADAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="STATIM" default="00 00 00"></a>
<a name="ENDDAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="ENDTIM" default="23 59 59"></a>
<p><b>Observation window:</b>
You may specify date and time for the begin and the end of the observation
window you want to display. If the fields remain empty all observations in
the file(s) are displayed. You can also specify either a start or an end epoch
for the display.

<p><i>Default values for daily processing:</i> Start date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
start time: <tt>00&nbsp;00&nbsp;00</tt>, end date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
end time: <tt>23&nbsp;59&nbsp;59</tt>
