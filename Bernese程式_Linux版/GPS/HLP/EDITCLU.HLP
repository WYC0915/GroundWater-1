<b>CREATE/UPDATE CLUSTER DEFINITION FILE</b>
<p>Editor: EDITCLU
</center>
<hr width="100%">

<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION </b>
<p>
This cluster definition file is used by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#SNGDIF">SNGDIF</a> to form clusters of baselines. This
input panel helps you to create or to edit this type of files.
<br>
To create a new cluster definition file specify a new filename in the file
selection dialogue. In this case you will be asked to select an existing
coordinate file. The station names will be read from this
file to generate a cluster definition file template.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The end of the cluster definition file is indicated by a blank line. Lines
below the blank line are ignored. If you use this input mask to edit a cluster
definition file these additional lines will be lost. If you want to keep them
in the file you have to use an external text file editor.
