<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION </b>
<p>
The program CCRNXC is the utility in the Bernese GNSS Software for
manipulating clock files in the clock RINEX format. Apart from combining
different clock files the program also allows to cut or to resample a
single clock RINEX file, or to extract specific clock values.
<br>
The main purpose of this program is the combination of clock RINEX files.
A time offset between the clock RINEX files is estimated once per epoch in
order to account for different reference clocks in the files. The clock
corrections from the input files are then corrected for this offset and are
combined using a weighted arithmetic mean. The reference clock for the
resulting clock file may be taken from one of the input files or it may be
selected automatically from a list of station and/or satellite clocks.
<br>
If the user specified time window exceeds the time interval covered
by the input file the clock corrections may be extrapolated. The clock
model function for the extrapolation may consist of a polynomial and
periodic terms. The clock model considers clock jumps detected by the
program.
<br>
The resulting clock values may be written into a clock RINEX file or
into a Bernese satellite clock file.
Ignoring most of the options, this program can be used to convert a clock
RINEX file to the Bernese clock format.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If station coordinates, terrestrial reference frame, and
leap seconds given in the headers of the input files are not identical, the
files are not combined.

<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
and will be saved in the result files to document the program run.
The title should characterize the program run by, e.g., giving the most
important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="USEWIN" default="0"></a>
<p><b>DEFINE EPOCHS TO BE PROCESSED</b>
<p><b>Use time window:</b>
Mark this checkbox to specify the time window to be processed. The option may be used
to cut the input clock RINEX files to a time interval or to extrapolate clock
values.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="DELTAT" default=""></a>
<p><b>Sampling rate for clocks:</b>
Specify the sampling rate of the clock values for the output file. Leave
the input field blank to take the highest sampling rate from the input
clock RINEX files (for option "Select a new reference clock for the output
file")
or that from the reference clock RINEX file (for option "Retain the reference
clock from an input file" in section "REFERENCE CLOCK SELECTION").
<br>
Only clocks for epochs corresponding to this sampling rate are
included in the clock combination. If you have, e.g., input files with a
sampling rate of 300 seconds and you request a sampling rate of 450 seconds,
the resulting file will contain clock values for only every 900 seconds.

<p><i>Default value:</i> blank

<br><br>

<a name="SELSTA" default="ALL"></a>
<a name="SELSAT" default="ALL"></a>
<p><b>DEFINE A LIST OF CLOCKS TO BE PROCESSED</b>
<p>
Define a list of clocks you want to process. Only the
clocks specified in this list will be used for the entire combination process.
Use this option to extract clocks of interest from the full set of available
input file clocks.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If the reference clock from an input clock RINEX file
is retained (see "REFERENCE CLOCK SELECTION") the reference clocks from
all input files are kept independently from the selection here.

<p><b>Selection of station clocks</b>,
   <b>Selection of satellite clocks:</b>
Clocks may be selected separately for stations and satellites.
You have several options to define the list of clocks.
<ul>
<li>NONE: No clocks will be included.
<li>FROM_FILE: The list with requested clocks is taken from a file.
<li>FROM_LIST: The desired clocks can be chosen manually.
<li>ALL: All clocks will be included.
</ul>

<a name="SFILSTA" default=""></a>
<a name="SFILSAT" default=""></a>
<p><b>List from file:</b>
The list with desired station/satellite clocks is taken from this selection
file.

<a name="SLSTSAT" default=""></a>
<p><b>Manual selection:</b>
The desired clocks may be selected manually. This is possible for stations
and satellites separately.

<a name="DELECLIPS" default="KEEP"></a>
<p><b>Remove clocks with eclipse flag:</b>
Handle entries with eclipse flags in the input clock files by keeping the flags
and records (<tt>KEEP</tt>), removing only the flags
(<tt>REMOVE_FLAG_ONLY</tt>),
or removing the whole corresponding records (<tt>REMOVE_ALL_RECORDS</tt>).

<p><b>CCRNXC 2.1: Time Window</b>

<a name="RADIO_1" default="1"></a>
<a name="SESSION_YEAR" default="$Y+0"></a>
<a name="SESSION_STRG" default="$S+0"></a>
<p><b>TIME INTERVAL TO BE PROCESSED</b>
<p>
This panel allows to specify a time window. Only clocks within this
time window will be used for processing. This window may be used to cut
large input clock RINEX files to a smaller time interval or to define the
clock extrapolation interval.
<br>
A time window definition without fixed dates is not possible in case of
extrapolation.
<br>
You may define the time window either by using session definitions, or by
explicitly specifying start and end times.

<p><b>Year and Session identifier:</b>
You may specify one session from the <a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session table</a>.
The boundaries of this session define the observation window. If you use an
open session table the year has to be specified in addition to the session
identifier. If you use a fixed session table the year is read from the session
definition and the value in the panel is ignored.
<br>
It is possible to specify a range of sessions using the corresponding
menu variable (<tt>$S+-</tt>). In this case the time window starts at the
beginning of the first session of the range and stops at the end of the last
session of the range. If you use an open session table the year should also
be given with the range variable (<tt>$Y+-</tt>).

<p><i>Default values:</i> Year: <tt>$Y+0</tt> session: <tt>$S+0</tt>

<a name="RADIO_2" default="0"></a>

<a name="ENDDAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="ENDTIM" default="23 59 59"></a>
<p><b>Start and End times:</b>
Specify date and time for the begin and the end of the observation window.
<br>
To specify a time window which is open on one side of the interval,
leave the corresponding input field for the start/end date empty. The
associated start/end time is then ignored.

<p><i>Default values for daily processing:</i> Start date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
start time: 00&nbsp;00&nbsp;00, end date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,

<a name="USESAT" default="1"></a>
<p><b>CLOCK RINEX FILE OFFSET ESTIMATION</b>
<p><b>Use all station clocks</b>,
   <b>Use all satellite clocks:</b>
The clock RINEX files can refer to different reference clocks. To
transform all files to the same reference, offsets between the individual
files have to be estimated. This is done epoch-wise by a least squares
adjustment for all files. You can include stations and/or satellite clocks
for this offset estimation.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked for station and satellite clocks

<a name="ONLYREF" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Use only reference clocks:</b>
Usually all station and satellite clocks in the clock RINEX files can be used
to estimate the clock offsets. Marking this checkbox, only reference clock(s)
of the clock RINEX files are used for the offset estimation. In this case you
loose the information from all other clocks.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="SIGMA0" default="0.02"></a>
<p><b>A priori sigma of unit weight:</b>
Specify the a priori sigma of unit weight for the offset estimation. The offset
between the clocks in each input clock file is computed independently for
each epoch in order to to absorb
the differences in the reference clocks from the individual input files.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0.02</tt> nanoseconds

<a name="MAXRESI" default="5"></a>
<p><b>Maximum residuum allowed:</b>
In a first iteration all clocks of an epoch are used for the offset estimation.
From this result the residuals for each clock are computed. Because bad
clock values may bias the estimation they are excluded from the final
estimation step if their residual exceeds the specified threshold.
<br>
To disable this option leave the input field empty.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5</tt> nanoseconds

<br><br>

<a name="COMBI" default="COMBINATION"></a>
<p><b>OPTIONS FOR CLOCK COMBINATION</b>
<p><b>Strategy for computation of mean value:</b>
After estimating and applying the individual clock offsets a mean value
of all clock values for stations and satellites from the different files is
computed for each epoch. These mean values are written into the resulting
clock file.
<br>
You may apply one of three weighting strategies to compute the arithmetic
mean of the aligned clocks:
<ul>
<li>UNWEIGHTED: Compute an unweighted mean.
<li>COMBINATION: The weights are taken from the deviation of the
    individual clock values from an unweighted mean. This option is
    appropriate for most cases.
<li>INPUT_FILES: The weights are defined by the sigma values given in
    the clock RINEX files. This may be useful if there are significant
    differences in the clock sigma values from different files. Make sure
    that all input clock RINEX files have comparable sigma values
    (which may, e.g., not be the case if using clock RINEX files from
    different software packages.)
</ul>

<p><i>Remark:</i> If a reference clock RINEX file is selected (see option
"Retain the reference clock from an input file" in the section "REFERENCE
CLOCK SELECTION") the values of the reference clocks from this file
remain unchanged.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>COMBINATION</tt>

<a name="MAXMEAN" default="5"></a>
<p><b>Maximum deviation from mean:</b>
If the difference between the computed (weighted) arithmetic mean and
a corrected clock value exceeds the threshold specified here, the corresponding
clock value will not be used to compute the mean value.
<br>This option is independent from the option "Maximum residuum allowed"
specified for the offset estimation (section "CLOCK RINEX FILE OFFSET
ESTIMATION").
<br>
To disable this option leave the input field empty.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5</tt> nanoseconds

<a name="MINSAT" default="1"></a>
<a name="MINSTA" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Minimum number of valid clocks for mean:</b>
This option is useful to define a minimum redundancy for each clock when
combining clock RINEX files.
Specify the minimum number of clock values required to compute the mean (after
removal of the outliers). You may specify separate numbers for stations
and satellites. If less than the specified clock contributions are available
for an epoch no clock corrections are written for the corresponding clock.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1</tt> (in both cases)

<a name="OUTSIG" default="INPUT_FILES"></a>
<p><b>Compute sigma in resulting clock RINEX file from:</b>
There are two possibilities to compute clock sigma values for the
clock RINEX output file:
<ul>
<li><b>INPUT_FILES:</b> based on the values from the input files the resulting
    sigmas are computed using the error propagation law.
<li><b>COMBINATION:</b> the sigmas are computed using the standard deviation
    of the corrected clock values.
</ul>
The weighting strategy for the arithmetic mean is taken into account in
both cases.
<br>
If the values for a clock are given in one input file only, the standard
deviation of the corrected clock values is zero. If the COMBINATION
option is selected the sigma for the clock is set to zero. If the combined
clocks originate from more than one input file the difference between both
options is in general not significant.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>INPUT_FILES</tt>

<p><b>CCRNXC 4: Select Program Functions, Program Output</b>

<a name="RADIO_N" default="1"></a>
<p><b>REFERENCE CLOCK SELECTION</b>
<p><b>Select a new reference clock for the output file:</b>
Independent of the reference clocks in the input files, a new reference clock
may be defined for the resulting clock RINEX file. In one of the
following panels you may specify detailed input options.
<br>
In any case a single reference clock is selected for the entire time
interval. Because no output can be written for epochs where the reference
clock is not available it is necessary to carefully select the reference clock.

<a name="RADIO_F" default="0"></a>
<a name="RCLKREF" default=""></a>
<p><b>Retain the reference clock from an input file:</b>
One of the input clock RINEX files may be selected as reference file.
When using this option please keep in mind that results can only be obtained
for epochs where the reference clock is available.
<br>
The reference clock from this file will be written unchanged into the
output clock RINEX file.
<br>
If no file is specified the first input file is selected as reference.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
An output clock file is only written if a reference clock
is available. If the input clock RINEX file has no reference clock specified
in the header you must use the option "Select a new reference clock for the
output file".

<br><br>

<a name="DOJUMP" default="1"></a>
<p><b>ENABLE OTHER PROGRAM FUNCTIONS</b>
<p><b>Enable clock jump detection:</b>
Switch clock jump detection on or off. The detected clock jumps are reported
in the program output. They are considered for the computation of the
statistical clock characteristics for the program output.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If clocks are extrapolated, the detected clock jumps are taken into account to compute the clock model.
It is therefore recommended to enable the clock jump detection for
the clock extrapolation.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<a name="DOEXTRA" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Enable extrapolation:</b>
Activate extrapolation of clocks. Detected clock jumps may be considered
when the clock model is computed. We recommend to mark the option "Enable
clock jump detection", too.
<br>
The length of the extrapolated time interval is defined by the time window
(option "Use time window" in section "DEFINE EPOCHS TO BE PROCESSED").

clock combination, reference clock selection, clock jump detection, and
clock extrapolation.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmark

<a name="PRTRES" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Statistic about the resulting clocks:</b>
The RMS of a low order polynomial fit and the number of clock values
in the input and output files are summarized in a table in the program
output.
<br>
If the jump detection is active clock jumps are considered when the
RMS of the polynomial fit is computed.

<p><i>Default value:</i> mark

<p><b>Sort order for clock statistics:</b>
In the statistics table the clocks may be sorted in three different ways:
<ul>
<li><b>NONE:</b> No sorting is done.
<li><b>ALPHA:</b> Sort alphabetically.
<li><b>SIGMA:</b> The clocks are sorted according to the linear fit RMS; station
    and satellite clocks are not mixed.

<a name="STAFIL" default=""></a>
<a name="SATFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>REFERENCE CLOCK SELECTION</b>
<p><b>Selection of potential reference clocks:</b>
To find a new reference clock the program needs a list with potential
reference clock candidates. The reference clock is selected automatically
from this list optimizing the number of epochs and the alignment of
all clocks.
<br>
You have several options to define this list:
<ul>
<li><b>FIRST_STATION:</b> The first station is used as new reference.
<li><b>LAST_STATION:</b> The last station is used as new reference.
<li><b>ALL_STATIONS:</b> The list of candidates contains all stations.
<li><b>MANUAL:</b> Allows you to manually select a list of station and/or
    satellites as candidates for a new reference.
<li><b>FROM_FILE:</b> Get the station and/or satellite list from a file.
    <br>
    <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.FIX">Example</a>

Usually it is the best choice to select one of the station clocks as reference
for the output.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>ALL_STATIONS</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="NALIGN" default="1"></a>
<p><b>ALIGNMENT OF NEW REFERENCE CLOCK</b>
<p><b>Polynomial degree for alignment:</b>
If no reference clock file is specified (option "Select a new reference
clock for the output file" in the section "REFERENCE CLOCK SELECTION")
the reference clock is
replaced by a zero mean condition during the combination process.
After the combination an alignment of the clock values to a new reference
clock is necessary. This is done using a low order polynomial fit for all
reference clock candidates from the list specified above. The alignment
of all clocks is checked (RMS of a polynomial fit) when using a potential
reference clock. Finally that clock is selected as reference clock for which the
best polynomial fit for all clocks is obtained. In addition, of course, the
number of available epochs for the reference clock is taken into account.
<br>
Specify the degree of the alignment polynomial in this field.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1</tt>

<a name="MAXREF" default=""></a>
<p><b>Maximum allowed RMS error for alignment:</b>
If the RMS error for the alignment exceeds this value it is assumed that the
alignment of the reference clock failed. The corresponding clock will not
be selected as new reference clock. If no clock fulfills the criterion no
reference clock is selected. Leave this field empty if the RMS error
should not be checked.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
This option may be useful if the clocks in the input
clock RINEX files are already aligned in order to speed up the alignment
process. The RMS has to be selected according to the quality of the
alignment of the clocks in the input files. This option may also be used
to prevent the use of a bad reference clock only based on the condition
of a maximum number of epochs (always fulfilled for an input reference clock).

<p><i>Default value:</i> blank

<p><b>CCRNXC 6: Options for Clock Jump Detection</b>

<a name="NJMPSIG" default="5"></a>
<p><b>CLOCK JUMP DETECTION</b>
<p><b>Confidence interval:</b>
The mean change of the clock values per seconds (the drift of the clock) is
computed together with its RMS (noise of the clock). A jump hypothesis is
setup if the change of the clock value between consecutive epochs is significantly
different from the mean change. The clock noise value is multiplied with the
confidence interval specified here in order to obtain the corresponding
threshold.
<br>
For each identified potential jump the mean change of the clock value is
computed together with its
RMS for the interval starting at 10 epochs before and ending 10 epochs after
the jump. This computation is done twice: once applying the jump at the epoch
and once ignoring the jump. The jump hypothesis holds if the RMS can be reduced
significantly by introducing the jump (the ratio between both RMS
values exceeds the confidence interval).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5</tt> sigmas

<a name="MJMPRMS" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Minimum RMS for jump detection:</b>
Specify a minimum clock RMS value. If the RMS error obtained from the
computation of the mean clock rate is smaller than this value it is
replaced by this minimum RMS. This is important for good clocks where
very small events with a size of a few ten picoseconds may otherwise
erroneously be detected as clock jumps.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1</tt> nanoseconds/300 seconds

<a name="NJMPEPO" default="5"></a>
<p><b>CLOCK JUMP OR OUTLIER</b>
<p><b>Maximum time interval for outlier detection:</b>
If two clock jumps are found for the
same clock within the time interval specified in this field (in number of
epochs) with the same size (but the opposite sign),
the clock values between these two events are marked as outliers and both
jumps are removed from the list of jumps. A test
assures that no jump is assumed for the last epoch before the first jump and
the first epoch after the second jump.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5</tt> epochs

<a name="DJMPSTA" default="0"></a>

<p><b>Remove outliers from output for stations</b>,
   <b>Remove outliers from output for satellites:</b>
Switch this option on to remove outliers (see above) in station and/or
satellite clocks. The removed outliers will not be written into the
resulting combined clock RINEX file.
<br>
Outliers may indicate real clock events. Therefore the clock values
should in general not be deleted if there is no further indication for the
outlier hypothesis.
<br>
In case of an extrapolation this is different. The outliers
may affect the estimated clock model and must be deleted.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="DJMPEST" default="0"></a>
<p><b>CLOCK JUMP VERIFICATION</b>
<p><b>Enable the clock jump verification:</b>
To estimate the size of the clock jumps a polynomial (the degree is specified
in the option "Polynomial degree for jump size estimation" below)
is set up for the entire time interval together
with a parameter for each detected jump for this clock. This is done for
statistical purposes only (to check the reliability of the jump detection).
<br>
Mark the checkbox to enable this computation.

<p><i>Default value:</i> mark

<a name="NJMPPOL" default="10"></a>
<p><b>Polynomial degree for jump size estimation:</b>
Specify the polynomial degree to verify the clock jumps. A polynomial
with the specified degree is estimated for each clock with a clock jump.
The clock jumps are setup as offset parameters which may be compared with
the size of the clock jump in the clock values for the epochs before and
after the event. This implies that the clock can be modeled as a polynomial
with the specified degree.

<p><b>CCRNXC 7: Options for Clock Extrapolation</b>

<a name="POLYNOM" default="1"></a>
<p><b>DEFINE EXTRAPOLATION MODEL</b>
<p>
Clock values are extrapolated using a model based on a polynomial and a
set of periodical functions. Clock specific model parameters are estimated
from the available data using the sigma values of the combined clock
values as weights. Jumps in clock values are taken into account if jump
detection is activated.
<br>
The estimated errors define the new accuracy codes for the resulting
extrapolated clock values which may therefore be very different
from the accuracy codes of the original clock values.

<p><b>Polynomial degree:</b>
One component of the extrapolation model is a polynomial of specified degree.
It is recommended to use a first order polynomial to model the clock drift
only.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1</tt>

<a name="PERIOD" default="2"></a>
<p><b>Periodical terms:</b>
Periodical functions with frequencies once/day, twice/day, etc. may be set
up in addition to the polynomial. For each component a sine and cosine term
are set up for each clock. Select the maximum frequency you want
to use (n times per day). A zero indicates that no periodical functions shall
be set up.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>2</tt>

<a name="MOREINEX" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Detailed setup for model function:</b>
This option enables a time dependent setup of the polynomial degree and
the periodical terms. You may specify the detailed setup of the

<a name="POLYOBS" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Minimum number of clock values for fit:</b>
Specify the minimum number of clock values you want to use for the
estimation of the extrapolation model function. If the number of
available epochs is lower no extrapolation is performed for
this clock. A clock should be present for about 90% of the time
interval to compute a reliable clock model function for extrapolation.

Specify individual parameters for the extrapolation model
function. The polynomial degree and periodical terms may be set up
independently for defined time intervals. In this way different model
functions for extrapolation may be used.
<br>
Define the maximum polynomial degree and the frequency of
periodical terms (in periods per day, e.g., 0.5 for a two days period).
