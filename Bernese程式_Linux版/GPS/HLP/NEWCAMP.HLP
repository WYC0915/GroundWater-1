<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION </b>
<p>
This panel specifies the list of campaign subdirectories that have to be
created for a new campaign. Additionally a list of files to be copied from
any directory of your system into the specified campaign subdirectories may
be defined.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If a campaign directory already exists, only the
subdirectories are created. A warning message <tt>Error creating
directory</tt> is issued for already existing subdirectories which remain
untouched. The files specified in the list
are, however, copied into the campaign and <i>overwrite</i> already
existing files.

<p><i>Remark for UNIX:</i>
You need - of course - write permission to create
the campaign directory and the subdirectories.
<br>
To create a new campaign follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Add the new campaign to the list under
      <b>Menu &gt; Campaign &gt; Edit list of campaigns</b>.
  <li>Select the campaign under
      <b>Menu &gt; Campaign &gt; Select active campaign</b>.
  <li>Create the corresponding directory tree using this program.
</ol>

<p><b>Copy files into the campaign:</b>
This list specifies the files which are copied into the campaign
after the creation of the tree. The filenames are specified including the source
path. The target subdirectory in the campaign structure needs also be
specified. Already existing files are overwritten. The following
files are required:
<table width="100%">
