<b>CREATE/UPDATE STATION ABBREVIATION TABLE</b>
<p>Editor: EDITABB
</center>
<hr width="100%">

<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION </b>
<p>
The station abbreviation file tabulates the <nobr>4-character</nobr> and
<nobr>2-character</nobr> abbreviations for the list of station names. This
input panel helps you to create or to edit this type of files.
<br>
Abbreviations should be unique. A warning is issued if equal
abbreviations are found in different lines when saving the file.
<br>
To create a new abbreviation table specify a new filename in the file
selection dialogue. In this case you will be asked to select an existing
coordinate file. The station names will be read from this
file to generate an abbreviation table template. The program suggests the first
four resp. two characters of the station name as abbreviations
regardless of possible multiple appearance of abbreviations.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The end of the abbreviation table is indicated by a blank line. Lines below the
blank line are ignored. If you use this input mask to edit an abbreviation table
these additional lines will be lost. If you want to keep them in the file
you have to use an external text file editor.
<br>
An abbreviation table may also be created or updated by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RXOBV3">RXOBV3</a> (see option
<a href="RXOBV3.HLP#ABBUPD">ABBUPD</a>).
