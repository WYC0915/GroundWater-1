<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
Use this program to generate a simple ASCII graphic file with information
about the observed satellites in RINEX observation files. The program output
gives you a summary of the observation material available in the selected
RINEX files. For time bins of 20 minutes the program output displays
<ul>
<li>the observed satellites for each individual station ('<tt>*</tt>' indicates that
    data for the bin are available; '-' indicates that a number of epochs
    is missing for the bin),</li>
<li>the number of stations which observed a particular satellite in the time bin
    ('<tt>*</tt>' if more than 9 stations),</li>
<li>the number of satellites observed by a station in the time bin
    ('<tt>*</tt>' if more than 9 satellites);
    <br>
    GPS and GLONASS are displayed in different graphs if the RINEX files
    contain observations from both satellite systems,</li>
<li>the number of stations providing an 'anti-spoofing' flag for the observations
    to the particular satellite in the time bin
    ('<tt>*</tt>' if more than 9 stations).</li>
</ul>
The program assumes that the observations from all RINEX files cover up to
24&nbsp;hours. The median of the first epoch from all RINEX files defines the
start epoch for all graphs.
<br>
The program may also be used to list poorly behaving stations based on
user-defined criteria, an option which is particularly useful for automatic
processing.

<p><b>Show all general files:</b>
If you check this box, the currently
active campaign, session and session table are displayed.

<br><br>

<a name="OBSFIL" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES:</b>
<p><b>Original RINEX observation files:</b>
Selection of one or more RINEX observation files. The RINEX files you
select should not cover more than 24&nbsp;hours of data and should all
belong to the same session. Leave the field blank if you want to create
the graphics from "Smoothed RINEX observation files" only.
<br>
Select the value for the two digit year in the extension for raw RINEX
observation files using the dialogue
<a href="SETDATE.HLP">Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Set session/compute day</a>.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>????$S+0</tt>

<a name="SMTFIL" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>Smoothed RINEX observation files:</b>
Selection of one or more smoothed RINEX files created by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a>. The smoothed RINEX files you
select should not cover more than 24&nbsp;hours of data and should all
belong to the same session. Leave the field blank if you want to create
the graphics from "Original RINEX observation files" only.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>????$S+0</tt>

<a name="SYSOUT"  default="RNXGRA"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<br><br>

<a name="SUMMARY" default=""></a>
<p><b>OUTPUT FILE</b>
<p><b>Summary file:</b>
Specify the name of the file where you want to have the summary printed.
It repeats a number of the graphs from the program output in an alternative
file (default extension SMC):
<ul>
<li>Number of stations that observed a particular satellite in the time bin
    ('<tt>*</tt>' if more than 9 stations).</li>
<li>Number of satellites observed by a station in the time bin
    ('<tt>*</tt>' if more than 9 satellites);
    <br>
    GPS and GLONASS are displayed in different graphs if the RINEX files
    contain observations from both satellite systems.</li>
<li>Number of stations providing an 'anti-spoofing' flag for the observations
    to the particular satellite in the time bin
    ('<tt>*</tt>' if more than 9 stations).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>RNXGRA 2: Options</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
and will be saved in all the result files to document the program run.
The title should characterize the program run by, e.g., giving the most
important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="MEATYP" default="PHASE"></a>
<p><b>OBSERVATION SELECTION</b>
<p><b>Measurement type:</b>
In this field you enter the measurement type (<b>PHASE</b> or <b>CODE</b>)
you would like to get statistical information about.

<a name="FREQ" default="BOTH"></a>
<p><b>Frequencies:</b>
Select the frequency (<b>L1</b>, <b>L2</b>, or <b>BOTH</b>) you would like
to get a summary of.
With the option <b>BOTH</b> the information will be displayed for both
frequencies which corresponds to the availability of observations when
forming linear combinations.

<a name="MINSIG" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Minimum s/n ratio requested:</b>
An observation in the RINEX file is only considered for the pseudo-graphic
and the statistics if its signal-to-noise-ratio is bigger than the value
specified in this input field. The intention of this option is that
the program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a> uses the s/n-ratio to
flag bad observations (s/n-ratio=1 for bad observations, s/n-ratio=9 for
good observations).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0</tt> for original RINEX observation files, and
                         <tt>2</tt> for smoothed RINEX observation files

<a name="CYCGRA" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Print cycle slip flags:</b>
If there are cycle slip flags in the RINEX observation file a
<tt>C</tt>-character may be printed into the corresponding position in the
pseudo-graphic of the program output.
The cycle slip flags from the smoothed RINEX files (result of the
program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a>) indicate the epochs where
ambiguities need to be setup.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<br><br>

<a name="IOBTOL" default="2"></a>
<p><b>MAXIMUM NUMBER OF MISSING EPOCHS</b>
<p><b>Allowed per character:</b>
The observations are grouped in bins of 20 minutes length, represented by a
character. With this option you specify a maximum number of missing
observations per satellite within a bin. As long as this number is not exceeded
the bin is marked as completely observed ('<tt>*</tt>'), otherwise the bin is
marked as incompletely observed ('-') in the graphic output.

<p><i>Default value:</i> 2

<br><br>

<a name="STAINFO" default=""></a>
<p><b>STATION NAME TRANSLATION</b>
<p><b>Station information file:</b>
You may use a station information file to translate the station names given
in the <tt>MARKER NAME</tt> header record of the RINEX observation files to make
sure that in the graphic output file you will
have correct station names. For this purpose the section <tt>TYPE 001: RENAMING
OF STATIONS</tt> in the station information file is used only. Wildcards may be
used in the file. If you leave this field blank, the station names will be
taken from the RINEX file(s) without any check or translation.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.STA">Example</a>

<!--
<a name="USEFLG" default="0"></a>
<a name="FLG001" default="999"></a>
<p><b>Flags to be used:</b>
<p>
All entries of the station information file have flags to switch the use
on or off easily for different programs. Specify here the flag to be used
for the station name translation in the file above. Put flag 999 to use
all flags in the file.

<p><i>Recommended value:</i> 999
-->

<a name="STNMSTOP" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Stop if station name not found:</b>
This option defines whether the program should stop if the station in
the RINEX file is not present in the renaming section (TYPE 001) of
the station information file or whether it should continue, just using
the RINEX station name without translation.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<br><br>

<a name="GETLST" default="0"></a>
<p><b>LIST OF RINEX FILES</b>
<p><b>Get a list of RINEX files:</b>
Here you may switch on an option to build a list of RINEX files which
meet conditions to be specified in the following panel. This list
of RINEX observation files may be useful for automatic processing.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="MAXSTA" default="200"></a>
<p><b>FILE SELECTION OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Maximum number of selected files:</b>
The maximum number of RINEX observation files to be selected can be
specified in this field. If more than this number of RINEX files meet the
conditions below the files with the biggest numbers of observations will
be selected.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>200</tt>

<a name="MINOBS" default="200"></a>
<p><b>Minimum number of observations per file:</b>
The number of satellites observed from a station in each time bin of the
'graphic' is summed up for the observation period. If this sum is smaller than
the specified value the RINEX observation file will be added to the list of
unselected files.
<br>
Marked epochs (character '-' in the graphic) and epochs with no data
(character '&nbsp;' in the graphic) are counted as 0. The observations
to GPS and GLONASS satellites are added in the case of stations with
combined receivers.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>200</tt>

<a name="MAXBAD" default="10"></a>
<p><b>Maximum number of bad epochs per file allowed:</b>
The number of 'bad epochs' (definition see below) per observation period is
specified in this field. If more than the specified number are found the
RINEX observation file will be added to the list of unselected files.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>10</tt>

<a name="BADOBS" default="3"></a>
<p><b>Maximum number of observations to define a bad epoch:</b>
The number of satellites observed from a station in a time bin of the
'graphic' is checked. If less than the specified number of satellites are
observed the time bin will be considered as 'bad epoch'. Marked epochs
(character '-' in the graphic) and epochs with no data (character '&nbsp;' in
the graphic) are also counted as 'bad epoch'.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>3</tt>
