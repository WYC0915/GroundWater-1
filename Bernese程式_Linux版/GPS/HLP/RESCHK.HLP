<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION </b>
<p>
This program analyzes the summary output of the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RESRMS">RESRMS</a> in order to detect bad stations
and misbehaving satellites. The residual summary may contain results on
zero difference as well as on single difference level.
<br>
The program RESCHK only handles one problem type per run, following
the priority
<ul>
<li>Satellite repositioning events,
<li>Bad stations,
<li>Misbehaving satellites.
</ul>
It is mainly used for a fully automated processing.

<p><b>INPUT FILE</b>
<p><b>Residual summary:</b>
Select the summary output from program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RESRMS">RESRMS</a>.
<br>
Basically RESCHK expects that
this file contains two concatenated summaries in succession. The first one
should have been created before, the second one after a data screening
step.
<br>
If you only want to detect bad stations the program analyzes only the
first summary table. Therefore it is possible in this case to have only one
table in the file. In order to detect satellite repositioning events it is
mandatory to have at least one pair of residual tables in this file.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If more than the required number of summaries are found
in the file the last summary resp. the last pair of summaries are analyzed.

<p><b>OUTPUT FILE</b>
<p><b>Short summary:</b>
If you provide a filename in this field, a short summary is created. It
contains various satellite-specific information such as the relative
percentage of observations, the total number of observations, and total
RMS per satellite.  The columns 'before' and 'after' indicate the values
before and after the data screening - they refer to the first respectively
the second residual table of a pair in the "Residual summary" file you have
specified in the section "INPUT FILE".

<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<p><hr>

<p><b>RESCHK 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="ABBREV" default="ABBREV"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Abbreviation table:</b>
The <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RESRMS">RESRMS</a> summary file contains the
<nobr>4-ID</nobr> for the stations used in that
program run. To enhance the program output of RESCHK the <nobr>4-IDs</nobr> can
be converted into the full station names using this table. If no file is
specified the <nobr>4-IDs</nobr> will be used to write the RESCHK program
output.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If one <nobr>4-ID</nobr> in the abbreviation table refers to
more than one station name the first site name is used.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ABB">Example</a>

<p><hr>

<p><b>RESCHK 2: Options</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
and will be saved in all the result files to document the program run.
The title should characterize the program run by, e.g., giving the most
important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="DIFRESI" default="SINGLE"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Difference level of residuals in summary:</b>
Specify the difference level of the residuals in the "Residual summary" file
you have specified in the section "INPUT FILE". Use <b>ZERO</b> respective
<b>SINGLE</b> to indicate a zero or a single difference residual summary.

<p><i>Caution:</i>
The program does not check your input. If you
specify a wrong difference level RESCHK assumes, e.g., baselines to stations
with blank <nobr>4-IDs</nobr> or ignores the second station of all baselines.
This may affect the detection of bad stations because in the zero resp. single
difference case the program uses different algorithms.

<a name="BADSTA" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Detect bad stations:</b>
Enable the detection of bad stations.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<a name="MANSAT" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Detect misbehaving satellites:</b>
Enable the search for misbehaving satellites, e.g., repositioning events.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If you have ftp access then you can get the file
indicating satellite problems (default $X/GEN/SAT_yyyy.CRX, where yyyy
is the four digit year) from the <a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous
ftp</a> account of AIUB. This file is updated every time when
a new satellite problem appears (satellite maneuvers, bad data,...) in the
routine processing for the IGS at CODE. If you can use this file
observations to misbehaving satellites will be rejected by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RXOBV3">RXOBV3</a> in your processing. It is, therefore,
not necessary for you to repeat the detection procedure for misbehaving
satellites.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="TSTMODE" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Analyze only first iteration:</b>
Usually the last pair of "Residual summary" tables in the "INPUT FILE" is
analyzed. Using this option you can force the program to analyze the first
pair of summaries. This may be useful, e.g., for debugging purposes.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<br><br>

<a name="SUMMARY" default="SUMMARY"></a>
<p><b>PROGRAM OUTPUT OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Level of detail:</b>
Select <b>SUMMARY</b> to get a short summary from the program run containing
only the final result together with the comment
<ul>
<li><tt>MANEUVER DETECTED FOR SATELLITE(s)</tt>,
<li><tt>BAD STATION(S) DETECTED</tt>,
<li><tt>BAD SATELLITE(s)</tt> detected, or
<li><tt>NO SPECIAL EVENTS FOUND IN THIS SOLUTION</tt>.
</ul>
To get the full information from the tests performed select <b>DETAILS</b>.

<p><b>RESCHK 2.1: Detection of Bad Stations</b>

<a name="MAXSTA" default="1"></a>
<p><b>OPTIONS FOR BAD STATION DETECTION</b>
<p><b>Maximum number of stations to delete:</b>
Specify the maximum number of stations to be marked as bad in one RESCHK
run. If more bad stations are found the stations with the biggest total RMS
errors are selected. If you analyze a single difference "Residual summary"
the total RMS of a station is computed as the mean RMS over all baselines
containing the station.
<br>
The phase preprocessing <a href="PGMLST.HLP#MAUPRP">MAUPRP</a> does a
good job in cleaning phase data (at least for baseline files). If the
options for this program are appropriate, it is, therefore, a very rare event
that the data of a station cannot be analyzed at all and must be excluded in
RESCHK. In this case a problem may be attributed to a misbehaving satellite.
<br>
On the other hand the results of the preprocessing in the zero difference
case depend on the quality of the code data (program
<a ref="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a>) or on the quality of introduced
satellite clocks (program <a ref="PGMLST.HLP#MAUPRP">MAUPRP</a>). It may,
therefore, be that the data from stations look bad due to problems
in the preprocessing.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1</tt> in the single resp. up to <tt>5</tt>
in the zero difference case

<a name="MAXRMS" default="6.0"></a>
<p><b>Maximum allowed overall RMS error:</b>
Specify the maximum allowed RMS error (total RMS of a station/baseline in the
last column of the "Residual summary" specified in the section "INPUT FILE")
for a 'good'
station. If this value is exceeded the station/baseline is assumed to be 'bad'.
<br>
In the case of single difference residuals the 'bad' stations are
extracted in the following way from the list of 'bad' baselines:
<ul>
<li>If a station from a 'bad' baseline is also found in addition in any
    'good' baseline, the station is assumed to be 'good'.
<li>If a station is found in only one baseline the other station of the
     baseline is checked. If this other station is found in 'bad' baselines
     only, the first station is marked as 'good'. If the second station
     is 'good', the first station is marked as 'bad' (it is assumed
     that a 'bad' baseline contains only one 'bad' station).
</ul>

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>6&nbsp;millimeters</tt> in the single and
<tt>30&nbsp;millimeters</tt> in the zero difference case

<a name="BADSOL" default="100.0"></a>
<p><b>RMS threshold level for a bad solution:</b>
In case of a zero difference solution usually one station figures as
clock reference station. If this station shows problems the overall
RMS errors for several additional stations may become very large and
the whole solution must be considered as bad.
<br>
If the total RMS for at least one station in the last column of the
"Residual summary" specified in the section "INPUT FILE" exceeds this
threshold level the whole solution is assumed to be bad. In this case only
the station with the biggest total RMS error will be marked as bad.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>100&nbsp;millimeters</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="DELSTA" default=""></a>
<p><b>SPECIAL OUTPUT FILE</b>
<p><b>File deletion list:</b>
All stations marked as 'bad' are listed in this file. The full path
and extension of all four types of Bernese zero difference observation
files (header and observation files for code and phase measurements) is
added. The file may be used to delete bad stations from the observation
directory of the campaign.
<br>
In the single difference case a new set of baselines should be created
without the bad stations using the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#SNGDIF">SNGDIF</a> after deleting the zero difference
observation files.

<p><b>RESCHK 2.2: Detection of Misbehaving Satellites</b>

<a name="CODXTR" default=""></a>
<p><b>SPECIAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p>
A <a href="PGMLST.HLP#CODSPP">CODSPP</a> extraction and an arc split
summary may contain hints for a repositioning of a satellite.  If at least
one of these files shows an indication of a repositioning a maneuver is
postulated for the corresponding satellites.  For these satellites the
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RESRMS">RESRMS</a> residual summary is checked using the
option "Maximum ratio of satellite RMS to overall RMS" in section "OPTIONS
FOR BAD SATELLITE DETECTION". If they show a normal behavior the maneuver
hypothesis is dropped. If no maneuver can be identified for any satellite,
the standard procedure to detect 'bad' satellites is started. For satellites
showing an anomalous behavior the procedure for detection repositioning
events is initiated.

Satellite 17 in the example below shows a big RMS, a maneuver hypothesis for
this satellite seems to be justified.

<a name="MAXORB" default="250"></a>
<p><b>OPTIONS FOR SATELLITE REPOSITIONING DETECTION</b>
<p><b>Maximum allowed arc split RMS:</b>
Analyzing an arc split summary file, a maneuver is postulated for all
satellites with bigger RMS errors than this value.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>250&nbsp;centimeters</tt>

<a name="MAXMRMS" default="2.5"></a>
<p><b>Maximum ratio of satellite RMS to overall RMS:</b>
If a maneuver is indicated in one of the "SPECIAL INPUT FILES" for at least
one of the satellites showing an anomalous behavior in the RESRMS residual summary
a test using the threshold specified in this field (instead of the same field
in section "OPTIONS FOR BAD SATELLITE DETECTION") is performed.
<br>
The value specifies the maximum allowed ratio of the overall RMS for one
satellite w.r.t. the mean total RMS for all satellites. The satellites for
which this ratio exceeds the specified value are assumed to be repositioned.
<br>
Usually a higher value for the RMS ration than in the section "OPTIONS
FOR BAD SATELLITE DETECTION" is selected in order to identify the correct
maneuver satellite in case the RMS ratio is increased for several satellites.
In fact, a maneuvering satellite may affect other satellites which may then
show an anomalous behavior, too.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
In the case of a maneuver hypothesis for at least one
satellite the RMS ratio is the only condition to identify the maneuver
satellite.
The percentage of deleted data is not considered.

<p><i>Remark on GLONASS:</i>
For GLONASS satellites a four times higher value is used.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>2.5</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="MAXARMS" default="5.0"></a>
<p><b>OPTIONS FOR BAD SATELLITE DETECTION</b>
<p><b>RMS threshold level for a bad solution:</b>
If the total RMS of a satellite in the "Residual summary" file (see section
"INPUT FILE") exceeds this value it is considered
a 'bad' satellite. If any of the "SPECIAL INPUT FILES" indicate a maneuver
for this satellite it is assumed that a repositioning occurred. Otherwise
the satellite is marked as 'bad'. In any case only the satellite with the
largest RMS exceeding the specified threshold is removed.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5&nbsp;millimeters</tt>

<a name="MAXRRMS" default="1.5"></a>
<p><b>Maximum ratio of satellite RMS to overall RMS:</b>
The ratio of the overall RMS for one satellite w.r.t. the mean total RMS for
all satellites is computed. If this ratio exceeds the specified maximum
ratio, the satellite is assumed to be bad because it shows a bigger
RMS than all the other satellites.
<br>
In a first step this value is only checked for possible maneuver
candidates (indicated by the "SPECIAL INPUT FILES"). If one of these exceeds
the specified threshold it is considered to be repositioned and the
corresponding test is repeated using the ratio specified in section "OPTIONS
FOR SATELLITE REPOSITIONING DETECTION" to confirm the maneuver. Otherwise
the maneuver hypothesis is rejected.
<br>
If all satellites with a maneuver hypothesis are checked this value is
applied to all remaining satellites to find out 'bad' satellites.

<p><i>Remark on GLONASS:</i>
For GLONASS satellites a four times higher value is used.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1.5</tt>

<a name="MAXDEL" default="5.0"></a>
<p><b>Maximal percentage of deleted data:</b>
The "Residual summary" lists the total number of the observations to each
satellite from all stations/baselines. It is assumed that the first table
in the "Residual summary" was written before and the second table after
a data screening step using the programs <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RESRMS">RESRMS</a>
and <a href="PGMLST.HLP#SATMRK">SATMRK</a> respectively.
<br>
The two values (before and after the screening step) for each satellite
are compared to detect satellites where a lot of data was
removed by the screening procedure. If more than the specified value of data
was lost, the corresponding satellite is marked as 'bad'.
<br>
This value is only checked if there is no maneuver hypothesis for any
satellite.

<p><i>Remark on GLONASS:</i>
For GLONASS satellites a four times higher value is used.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5%</tt>

<a name="MINOBSG" default="1"></a>
<a name="MINOBSR" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Minimum number of observations required for GPS</b>/<b>GLONASS:</b>
If there are less observations available for a satellite than specified in
this field, the respective satellite is reported as
<tt>SATELLITE(s) WITH FEW OBSERVATIONS</tt>. The threshold can be specified for
GPS and GLONASS separately.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1%</tt>

<a name="DEL1SAT" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Delete only one satellite per run: </b>
It is possible that a bad satellite affects additional satellites due
to correlations. After removing this bad satellite, all other satellites
are okay. To prevent a wrong removal of 'good' satellites due to this
effect you can request to remove only one satellite per program run.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<br><br>

<a name="SATCRUX" default="SAT_$Y+0"></a>
<p><b>SPECIAL OUTPUT FILE</b>
<p><b>File with satellite problems:</b>
If a repositioning or a misbehaving satellite was detected an existing
satellite problem file may be updated. Specify the name of the file here.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The "Residual summary" table contains only the session
identifiers. If you are using an open <a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session table</a>
the session identifiers indicate the day of year only. The year is taken
from the current session you have selected in the dialogue
<a href="SETDATE.HLP">Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Set session/compute day</a>.
If you are using a fixed session table the session identifier can directly
be transformed into the sessions time interval.
