<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION </b>
<p>
This dialog box is used to define the current session which is
one of the basic settings for the processing. It is used to define the
<a href="MENU_VAR.HLP#VAR_PLUS">time variables</a> provided by the menu.
The current session is defined by specifying the day to be processed,
the session character, and the <a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session table</a> which
must contain the session to provide the corresponding time window.
<br>
In addition the dialogue provides an input field to define a "Job ID"
which can be used to distinguish the output of several runs of the
same program running at the same time.

<p><hr>

<p><b>DEFINE THE DAY</b>
<p>
The day of the session you have to specify in this first part of the
dialogue defines the first three character of the default session. There
are four possibilities to define the day of the session:
<ul>
<li><b>Year, Month, Day</b>
<li><b>Modified Julian Date</b>
<li><b>GPS Week, Day of Week</b>
<li><b>Year, Day of Year</b>
</ul>
You can enter the requested date in one of these input fields by pushing the
button just right of the field. To complete the other fields with the
corresponding representation of the day press the <tt>Compute</tt> button below
this section.
<br>
Using the buttons <tt>+1</tt> and <tt>-1</tt> you may increment or decrement
the current day by one.

<br><br>

<p><b>DEFINE THE SESSION</b>
<p><b>Session Char:</b>
Enter a character or a digit to complete the session identifier. The menu
system adds this character to the day of year specified above. The resulting
string is the current session of the processing.

<p><b>Session Table:</b>
This file contains the <a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session definition</a>, defining
the time interval for the sessions to be processed. It must contain at least
the current session you have defined above.

<p><i>Default value: </i><tt>SESSIONS</tt>

<br><br>

<p><b>DEFINE THE JOB ID</b>
<p><b>Job ID:</b>
The Job ID is appended to the extension of the program input files in your
user specific panel directory. In this way you may predefine panels with
different settings of options for the same program which you may address
with the Job ID.
<br>
If you would like to run more than one job of the same program at the
same time, you have to use different job identification characters to obtain
independent input files for the program runs.
<br>
The Job ID defines the value of the predefined
<a href"=MENU_VAR.HLP">menu variable</a> <tt>$J</tt>, which you can use in all
input panels. It may be used, e.g., to easily distinguish the temporary file if
you run the same program more than once at the same time.
<br>
You should not specify more than two characters for the Job ID.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
For the BPE no Job ID is used at all - even if you have specified one.

<br><br>

<p><b>CLOSE THE DIALOGUE</b>
<p>
There are three buttons to close the dialogue:
<br>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Set:</b></td>
    <td>Completes the computation for the day of the
        session and composes the current session
        from the day and the session character. The session table is checked
        to get the corresponding time window and to find the preceding and
        following sessions to create the menu time variables.
        <br>The current session and the Job ID are taken over by the actual
        menu processing but the dialogue box remains opened.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>OK:</b></td>
    <td>The current session and the time variables are
        constructed in the same way than for the
        Set-button. The current session and the Job ID are taken over by
        the actual menu processing and the dialogue box is closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Cancel:</b></td>
    <td>Exit the dialog box without changing the value
        of the current session, of the Job ID, and of the menu time
        variables.</td>
</tr>
</table>
The current session and year are displayed in the status bar of
the menu. If you have defined a Job ID it is shown, too.
