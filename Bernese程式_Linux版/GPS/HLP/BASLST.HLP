<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
With the program BASLST you can automatically select baselines from
a given list of single difference files using several selection criteria.
The accepted and rejected baselines are written in two
different output files. It is possible to select baselines by means of:
<ul>
<li>maximum/minimum baseline length
<li>maximum/minimum percentage of resolved ambiguities
<li>name of the involved receivers
</ul>

<p><b>BASLST 1: Input Files</b>

<a name="SHOWGEN" default="1"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL FILES</b>
<p><b>Show all general files:</b>
Check this box to get a list of the general input files used by this program
as well as the currently active campaign, session, and session table.

<br><br>

<a name="MEATYP" default="PHASE"></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Measurement type:</b>
Select the measurement type (PHASE or CODE) of the single
difference files you want to use.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>PHASE</tt>

<a name="CSHFIL" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>Code single differences:</b>
Select the code single difference files from which you want to select
the baselines.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>????$S+0</tt>

<a name="PSHFIL" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>Phase single differences:</b>
Select the phase single difference files from which you want to select
the baselines.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>????$S+0</tt>

<a name="COORD" default=""></a>
<p><b>Station coordinates:</b>
Specify a coordinate file which contains all involved stations.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.CRD">Example</a>

<a name="ARSUM" default=""></a>
<p><b>Ambiguity resolution summary:</b>
If you want to use the number of resolved ambiguities as criterion you
have to specify a summary file of the ambiguity resolution generated by
program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSXTR">GPSXTR</a>. The summary
must either be a Melbourne-Wuebbena or QIF summary.
<br>
This option is only active for phase single difference files.

<p><b>BASLST 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="CONST" default="CONST."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>General constants:</b>
This file contains all the physical and astronomical constants used
in the Bernese GNSS Software. Most probably you will never have to
modify this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">$X/GEN/CONST.</a>

<a name="DATUM" default="DATUM."></a>
<p><b>Geodetic datum:</b>
This file contains the definition of the geodetic datum and of the
ellipsoid to be used to compute ellipsoidal coordinates. It is used
to apply antenna heights and for the printing of coordinates in the
local system (north, east, up). You only have to modify this file
when you want to introduce a new reference ellipsoid.

<p><i>Caution:</i>
This file has no effect on Cartesian coordinates.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/DATUM.">$X/GEN/DATUM.</a>

<a name="ABBREV" default="ABBREV"></a>
<p><b>Abbreviation table:</b>
This file must contain the four-character and the two-character abbreviations
for all stations involved.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ABB">Example</a>

<p><hr>

<b>BASLST 2: Output Files</b>

<a name="SELBSL" default=""></a>
<p><b>RESULT FILES</b>
<p><b>List with accepted baselines:</b>
This list contains the names (four characters without session identifier,
i.e., the two-character abbreviations of the involved pair of stations)
of all accepted baselines.

<a name="NOTBSL" default=""></a>
<p><b>List with rejected baselines:</b>
This list contains the names (four characters without session identifier,
i.e., the two-character abbreviations of the involved pair of stations)
of all rejected baselines.

<br><br>

<a name="SYSODEF" default="1"></a>
<a name="SYSOUT"  default="BASLST"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
year and day of year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or to specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<p><hr>

<b>BASLST 3: Options</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE:</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
to document the program run.
The title should characterize the program run by, e.g., giving the most
important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="SATSYS" default="ANY_SYSTEM"></a>
<p><b>BASELINE SELECTION OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Baselines with observations from:</b>
Only baselines with observations from specific GNSS are selected.
<tt>ANY_SYSTEM</tt> disables this option.

<a name="MAXLEN" default="10000"></a>
<p><b>Maximum baseline length:</b>
Only baselines shorter than this value are selected. The length of the
baselines is computed from the "Station coordinates" given in the
"INPUT FILES" section.

<a name="MINLEN" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Minimum baseline length:</b>
Only baselines longer than this value are selected. The length of the
baselines is computed from the "Station coordinates" given in the
"INPUT FILES" section.

<a name="MAXAR" default="100"></a>
<p><b>Maximum percentage of resolved ambiguities:</b>
Only baselines for which the percentage of resolved ambiguities is smaller
than this value are selected.
<br>
This option is only available if the measurement type is <tt>PHASE</tt>
and if an "Ambiguity resolution summary" file is selected in the "INPUT FILES"
section.

<a name="MINAR" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Minimum percentage of resolved ambiguities:</b>
Only baselines for which the percentage of resolved ambiguities is greater
than this value are selected.
<br>
This option is only available if the measurement type is <tt>PHASE</tt>
and if an "Ambiguity resolution summary" file is selected in the "INPUT FILES"
section.

<a name="RECVR" default=""></a>
<p><b>Receiver name pattern to be included:</b>
Only baselines for which both involved stations are using this
receiver type are selected.

<a name="EXCLU" default=""></a>
<p><b>Receiver name pattern to be excluded:</b>
Baselines for which one of the involved stations is using this
receiver type are not selected.
