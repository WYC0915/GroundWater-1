<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
With this program you can look at the residuals that have been written
by one of the following programs:
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#ORBGEN">ORBGEN</a>,
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#CODSPP">CODSPP</a>,
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#MAUPRP">MAUPRP</a>,

<p>For each epoch one line is written. The epoch number indicates
the number of epochs elapsed since the reference epoch reported in the header
of the table. The residuals are reported in the column of the satellite they
refer to. The column remains blank if no residual to the corresponding
satellite is available for the epoch. Empty lines indicate missing epochs
either due the sampling during processing or due a lack of data in the
observation file. The units are selected by the user (see option "Units"
below).

<p>For each epoch one line is written. The epoch number indicates
the number of epochs elapsed since the reference epoch reported in the header
of the table. Each column refers to the double difference residuals of
two satellites: first column: satellites 1 and 2; second column: satellites
2 and 13; third column: satellites 13 and 20; and so on. In the example above
the satellite 2 was not available for the epochs 3 and 4. It is, therefore,
not possible
to report double difference residuals between satellites 1 and 2 and between
2 and 13 (first and second columns). But it is possible to display the double
difference residual between the satellites 1 and 13. To indicate this situation
the value of the residual is written into the first column and the '<tt>*</tt>'
character into the second column. Analogously the residual of
5&nbsp;millimeters at the fifth epoch is the double difference residual
between the satellites 27 and 17.

<p><b>GENERAL FILES</b>
<p><b>Show all general files:</b>
Check this box to get a list of the general input files used by this program
as well as the currently active campaign, session, and session table.

<br><br>

<a name="RESIDUA" default=""></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Residual file:</b>
Select the binary residual file which should be displayed.

<br><br>

<a name="SYSODEF" default="1"></a>
<a name="SYSOUT"  default="REDISP"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<p><b>REDISP 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="CONST" default="CONST."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>General constants:</b>
This file contains all the physical and astronomical constants used
in the Bernese GNSS Software. Most probably you will never have to
modify this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">$X/GEN/CONST.</a>

<a name="SATELL" default="SATELLIT.I08"></a>
<p><b>Satellite information:</b>
This file contains general information on GNSS (and LEO/GEO) satellites.
For the session to be processed,
each satellite has to appear once in this file
within a corresponding time window.

<p><i>Note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08 is maintained by AIUB/CODE.
It includes a complete history concerning the GPS satellite constellation
(and newly launched satellites are regularly added).
You can get the latest version of this file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<p><b>REDISP 2: Display Characterization</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
to document the program run. The title should characterize the program run by,
e.g., giving the most important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="IFILE" default=""></a>
<p><b>RESIDUAL DISPLAY SELECTION</b>
<p><b>Which file should be displayed:</b>
One residual file may contain the residuals of more than one satellite
arc, station, or baseline. In the selection list you get
<ul>
<li>for satellite arc residuals: arc number, reference epoch, and the
    components RADial, a LONg track, resp. OUT of plane for the residuals.
<li>for observation file residuals: the station name(s), reference epoch,
    measurement type, difference level, and a list of frequencies in
    residual file.
</ul>
Here you have to select the satellite arc, station, or baseline of which you
want to print the residuals. Please repeat this selection for each individual
residual file you have selected in the "INPUT FILES" section because all
entries (even the index number in the residual file) will be checked for the
selection.

<br><br>

<a name="IUNIT" default="MILLIMETERS"></a>
<p><b>RESIDUAL DISPLAY CHARACTERIZATION</b>

<p><b>Units:</b>
Specify the units for the residuals. In most cases <b>METERS</b> (e.g.,
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#CODSPP">CODSPP</a>-residuals) or <b>MILLIMETERS</b> (e.g.,
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#ORBGEN">ORBGEN</a>-residuals, or
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>-residuals)
are appropriate. In the case of <a href="PGMLST.HLP#MAUPRP">MAUPRP</a>
residuals expressed in <b>CYCLES</b> may be
more useful to verify the reliability of the cycle slip detection.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>MILLIMETERS</tt>

<a name="ICYCLE" default="L1"></a>
<p><b>Cycle type:</b>
If you selected <b>CYCLES</b> in the previous option "Units" you have to specify
specify here the corresponding frequency. Either the wavelength for <b>L1</b>
or <b>L2</b> is used. <b>L1/L2</b> corresponds to the narrow lane linear
combination. It works only if L3 residuals are available.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>L1</tt>

<a name="IWLFAC" default="FULL"></a>
<p><b>Wavelength factor:</b>
If you selected <b>CYCLES</b> in the option "Units" you have to specify here either
<b>HALF</b> or <b>FULL</b> cycles for the definition of the unit of the cycles. Half cycles
result from the squaring technique used by old receivers to get access to the L2
frequency.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>FULL</tt>

<a name="ICARR" default="L3"></a>
<p><b>Frequency for residual display:</b>
If the residual file contains only one frequency the corresponding frequency
is set automatically. If more than one frequency is stored in the
residual file you may select
<ul>
<li><b>RAD</b> (radial component), <b>LON</b> (component along track),
    or <b>OUT</b> (out of plane component) for satellite arc residuals, or
<li>one of the frequencies <b>L1</b>, <b>L2</b>, <b>L3</b>, <b>L4</b>, or
    <b>L5</b> for observation residuals.
</ul>
The selected frequency must be one of the frequencies in the residual file.
<br>
There is one exception: The program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#MAUPRP">MAUPRP</a> stores residual files containing L1 and
L2 residuals. They are written in a way that the program REDISP is able to
display residuals for all linear combinations.

<a name="RESSIZ" default=""></a>
<p><b>Minimal size of residuals:</b>
Specify the minimal size of residuals which are printed. Only those epochs
are displayed containing at least one residual bigger than this value.
<br>
Zero or an empty field means that all residuals are printed.

<p><i>Default value:</i> blank

<p><hr>

<p><b>REDISP 3: Time Window</b>

<a name="RADIO_0" default="0"></a>
<p><b>TIME WINDOW FOR OUTPUT</b>
<p>
This panel allows to specify a time window. Only residuals
within this time window will be printed.
<br>
You may define the time window either by using all available residuals,
by session definitions, or by explicitly specifying start and end times.

<p><b>Show all residuals:</b> Select this option to show all residuals
available in the residual file.

<a name="RADIO_1" default="1"></a>
<a name="SESSION_YEAR" default="$Y+0"></a>
<a name="SESSION_STRG" default="$S+0"></a>
<p><b>Year and Session identifier:</b>
You may specify one session from the <a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session table</a>.
The boundaries of this session define the observation window. If you use an
open session table the year has to be specified in addition to the session
identifier. If you use a fixed session table the year is read from the session
definition and the value in the panel is ignored.
<br>
It is possible to specify a range of sessions using the corresponding
menu variable (<tt>$S+-</tt>). In this case the time window starts at the
beginning of the first session of the range and stops at the end of the last
session of the range. If you use an open session table the year should also
be given with the range variable (<tt>$Y+-</tt>).

<p><i>Default values:</i> Year: <tt>$Y+0</tt> session: <tt>$S+0</tt>

<a name="RADIO_2" default="0"></a>
<a name="STADAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="STATIM" default="00 00 00"></a>
<a name="ENDDAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="ENDTIM" default="23 59 59"></a>
<p><b>Start and End times:</b>
Specify date and time for the begin and the end of the observation window.
<br>
To specify a time window which is open on one side of the interval,
leave the corresponding input field for the start/end date empty. The
associated start/end time is then ignored.

<p><i>Default values for daily processing:</i> Start date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
start time: <tt>00&nbsp;00&nbsp;00</tt>, end date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
end time: <tt>23&nbsp;59&nbsp;59</tt>
