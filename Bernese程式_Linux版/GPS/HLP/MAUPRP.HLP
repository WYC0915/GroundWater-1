<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
The main purpose of program MAUPRP is the preprocessing of the phase
observations on the zero- resp. <nobr>single-difference</nobr> level.
The program scans the observations looking for cycle slips.
If a cycle slip is found, the program will try to correct the observations.
However, if the size of the cycle slip could not be determined reliably the
program will remove the data point as an outlier or introduce a new ambiguity
parameter.
<br>
The program MAUPRP is able to preprocess GPS-only, GLONASS-only, as well
as GPS/GLONASS-combined data.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
Use this program with single-difference files when ever
possible because for zero-difference files the quality of the screening of the
phase observation files depends on the accuracy of the introduced satellite
clocks. You will need an epoch to epoch accuracy level of about
0.1&nbsp;nanosecond for the satellite clocks to be able to detect all
cycle slips.

<p><b>MAUPRP 1: Input Files</b>

<a name="SHOWGEN" default="1"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL FILES</b>
<p><b>Show all general files:</b>
Check this box to get a list of the general input files used by this program
as well as the currently active campaign, session, and session table.

<br><br>

<a name="RADIO_Z" default="0"></a>
<a name="PZFILES" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Zero-difference observation files:</b>
Select the zero-difference phase observation files to be preprocessed.
Several files may be preprocessed in the same program run.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>????$S+0</tt>

<a name="RADIO_S" default="1"></a>
<a name="OBSFIL" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>Single-difference observation files:</b>
Select the single-difference phase observation files to be preprocessed.
Several files may be preprocessed in the same program run.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>????$S+0</tt>

<a name="COORD" default=""></a>
<p><b>A priori coordinates:</b>
Select an a priori coordinate file. This coordinate file must contain all
the sites you are processing. The a priori coordinates should be accurate to
about 1 m or better.
<br>
Otherwise a new set of coordinates should be estimated by an epoch
difference solution and saved in a "Coordinate results" file (see
section "RESULT FILES"). For this special MAUPRP run - to perform the epoch
difference solution - the option "Save screened observation files" (see
section "GENERAL SETTINGS") may be disabled in order to keep the phase
observation files unchanged. Use the updated coordinate file to rerun
MAUPRP in order to perform the screening of the phase observation files.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
A more convenient way to get good a priori coordinates is
to use the 'Precise Point Positioning' example (DOCU_PPP).

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.CRD">Example</a>

<a name="ECCENT" default=""></a>
<p><b>Site eccentricities:</b>
Optionally, a site coordinate eccentricity file may be specified
containing local ties between markers.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ECC">Example</a>

<a name="KININP" default=""></a>
<p><b>Kinematic input coordinates:</b>
If an observation file contains one (or more) moving stations (may be even a
LEO satellite) these epoch-wise kinematic coordinates may be used as a
priori information instead of the constant "A priori coordinates" specified
above. Usually such a file is the result of the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a> from a previous iteration. At the
moment MAUPRP is not able to store kinematic positions in an output file.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
Please be aware that only epochs with 'good' kinematic
positions flagged by letter <tt>K</tt> in the kinematic coordinate file are
introduced. All observations of the other epochs are marked. All
entries are used as a priori if the "Kinematic coordinate estimation"
(see section "EPOCH-DIFFERENCE SOLUTION") is enabled for the current
program run.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.KIN">Example</a>

<a name="STDORB" default=""></a>
<p><b>GNSS standard orbits:</b>
Exactly one GNSS standard orbit file covering the desired observation interval
has to be selected (LEO orbits have to be specified by a separate standard
orbit file, see section "INPUT FILES FOR LEO PROCESSING"). Be sure
to specify the pole information corresponding to the standard orbit as the
"Pole file" below.

<a name="POLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>Pole file:</b>
This file contains the Earth rotation parameters (ERP's). It is used for
the transformations between the International Celestial Reference Frame
(ICRF) and the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). This
file has to be identical to the one used for the computation of the standard
orbit.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ERP">Example</a>

<a name="SATCLK" default=""></a>
<p><b>Satellite clocks:</b>
The program may use a satellite clock file. On the single-difference level
satellite clock errors are almost completely eliminated, if both receivers
take the measurements simultaneously within 1&nbsp;ms. Therefore, it is usually
not necessary to use a satellite clock file when processing
<nobr>single-difference</nobr> observation files.
<br>
When screening zero-difference observation files the accuracy of the
satellite clocks from this file will define the quality of the phase data
screening. To detect all cycle slip an epoch to epoch accuracy level of
0.1&nbsp;nanosecond is required.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE1.CLK">Example</a>

<a name="TROPEST" default=""></a>
<p><b>Estimated troposphere values:</b>
You may introduce troposphere estimates stemming from previous
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a> or
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a> runs or from other sources (e.g.,
from CODE).

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.TRP">Example</a>

<a name="METFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Meteo data files:</b>
Measured surface meteorological data may be used to compute the tropospheric
delays. One meteorological data file
per station has to be specified. These
Meteo data are used to compute the troposphere delay with the model selected
in option "ZPD model and mapping function" of the section "TROPOSPHERE
MODELING".

   <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE2.MET">Example 2</a>,
   <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE3.MET">Example 3</a>

<a name="VMF1_FILES" default=""></a>
<p><b>Maps of VMF1 coefficients:</b>
For the continued fraction of the troposphere mapping function, the
Vienna Mapping Functions 1 (VMF1, <a href="REFERENCES.HLP#Boehm_etal_2006">
Boehm et al., 2006</a>) rely on global grids of the a, b, and c coefficients,
partly based on the ray-tracing of the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) numerical weather models output. For more details
on the VMF1 or to download VMF1 grids, please visit the
<a href="LINKS.HLP#VMF1">VMF1 website</a>.

<a name="IONOS" default=""></a>
<p><b>Ionosphere models:</b>
The program may take ionosphere models (Bernese format) produced by program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#IONEST">IONEST</a> or by program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a> into account. However, it does not help
very much to apply an ionosphere model correction in most cases. Use the
ionosphere-free linear combination (L3) for the epoch-difference solution in
all cases where possible.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE2.ION">Example</a>

<a name="LEOPROC" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Process LEOs:</b>
Check this box to preprocess observation files stemming from GPS receivers
on board of LEOs. If this box is marked all files containing observations from
at least one LEO are automatically selected from the specified
observation files. If this box is unmarked observation files containing LEO
observations are ignored.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The <tt>MARKER TYPE</tt> in part <tt>TYPE 005: HANDLING STATION TYPES</tt>
of the "Station information" file (see section "GENERAL INPUT FILES") has
to be <tt>SPACEBORNE</tt> to flag a GPS receiver as a LEO satellite.

to apply antenna heights and for the printing of coordinates in the
local system (north, east, up). You only have to modify this file
when you want to introduce a new reference ellipsoid.

<p><i>Caution:</i>
This file has no effect on Cartesian coordinates.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/DATUM.">DATUM.</a>

<a name="SUBMOD" default="IERS2010XY"></a>
<p><b>Subdaily pole model:</b>
This file contains the parameters for the subdaily pole model. It
has to be identical to the one used for the computation of the
standard orbit.

<a name="NUTMOD" default="IAU2000R06"></a>
<p><b>Nutation model:</b>
This file contains the parameters for the nutation model. It

<a name="SATELL" default="SATELLIT.I08"></a>
<p><b>Satellite information:</b>
This file contains general information on GNSS (and LEO/GEO) satellites.
For the session to be processed,
each satellite has to appear once in this file
within a corresponding time window.

<p><i>Note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/SATELLIT. is maintained by AIUB/CODE.
It includes a complete history concerning the GPS satellite constellation
(and newly launched satellites are regularly added).
You can get the latest version of this file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<a name="SATCRUX" default="SAT_$Y+0"></a>
<p><b>Satellite problems:</b>
This file contains information on satellite problems concerning modeling.
It is used for exclusion of misbehaving satellites
(and for orbit arc splitting).
It may also contain (mean) epochs of GPS repositioning events.

<p><i>Note:</i>
Corresponding year-specific files are maintained by AIUB/CODE.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>SAT_$Y+0</tt>

<a name="STAINFO" default=""></a>
<p><b>Station information:</b>
This file contains station specific information. The program only considers
the marker types (TYPE 005: HANDLING STATION TYPES) contained in this file.
Receivers in the observation files are handled as LEO-satellites if the
'station' is indicated as <tt>SPACEBORNE</tt> here.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.STA">Example</a>

<a name="PHASECC" default="PCV.I08"></a>
<p><b>Phase center eccentricities:</b>
This file contains receiver antenna phase center offsets and optionally
elevation-dependent phase center patterns.
In addition, the file may contain satellite-specific antenna
phase center patterns (dependent on nadir angle) as well as offset values.
Corresponding offset (correction) values, however, are not yet considered
by the software.
The satellite antenna offset values applied correspond to
those given in <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">SATELLIT.I08</a>.
<br>
You have to modify this file when you use a new antenna type
or when you wish to consider your own PCV calibrations.
The program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ATX2PCV">ATX2PCV</a> allows to convert
PCV information given in ANTEX format into Bernese-formatted PCV tables.

<p><i>Important note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.REL contains PCV values
for most of the receiver antenna types commonly used
within IGS (and EUREF).
These PCV values are addressed as 'relative' values
as they are generally referred to
a specific receiver antenna type (AOAD/M_T).
For this reference antenna type
(as well as implicitly all GNSS antenna types),
PCV patterns are assumed to be nonexistent.
Sooner or later, it will become common to consider 'absolutely' calibrated
receiver and satellite antenna PCV values.
A corresponding file ($X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.ABS) will be made available
as soon as this is the case.

<p><b>MAUPRP 1.2: LEO Processing</b>

<a name="LEOSTD" default=""></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES FOR LEO PROCESSING</b>
<p><b>LEO standard orbit:</b>
Specify the standard orbit file for the LEO. If no LEO positions and
velocities are available in the files specified in "Kinematic input
coordinates" (see section "INPUT FILES") and "Kinematic velocities"
(see below) respectively, the positions and velocities of the LEO are
taken from the LEO standard orbit.

<a name="ATTIT" default=""></a>
<p><b>LEO attitude:</b>
Specify the LEO attitude file.

<a name="GPSUTC" default="GPSUTC."></a>
<p><b>GPS-UTC seconds:</b>
Specify the file with GPS-UTC values. You have to update this file each time
a leap second is introduced. This file is only necessary together with a
JASON attitude file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/GPSUTC.">GPSUTC.</a>

<a name="KINVEL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Kinematic velocities:</b>
Specify the file containing LEO-kinematic velocities accompanying the
kinematic positions specified in "Kinematic input coordinates" in the

<p><hr>

<p><b>MAUPRP 2: Output Files</b>

<a name="COORDRS" default=""></a>
<p><b>RESULT FILES</b>
<p><b>Coordinate results:</b>
Specify a coordinate file name to save the coordinate estimates of the
epoch-difference phase solution. The results of the epoch-difference
solution may provide a priori coordinates for the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>.
<br>
If you are preprocessing single-difference observation files the result of
the epoch-difference solution (triple-difference solution) are coordinate
vectors of the second station of the baseline relative to the first
station. If all single-difference files of a session are preprocessed
together the program will generate a consistent set of coordinates for all
sites relative to the fixed site defined in "Define the fixed station" (see
section "SAVING COORDINATES" below).
<br>
If not all baselines are connected the program will have to select one
or more additional fixed sites. They will all get the flag 'F' in the
resulting coordinate file (all estimated sites will be flagged with 'T' for
'Triple-difference').
<br>
If you are preprocessing zero-difference files the coordinates estimated in
the epoch-difference solution (i.e., double difference between two
satellites and two epochs of one station) are stored with the flag 'U' (for
'Undifferenced'). No fixed stations are necessary because coordinate
estimates are obtained for all stations.
<br>
If the field is left blank no coordinates will be saved.

<a name="RESIDRS" default=""></a>
<p><b>Residual file:</b>
Specify a filename to save the residuals of the epoch-difference solution.
All preprocessing actions (e.g., marking of observations, cycle slip
corrections) are applied when the residuals are generated. The residual
file will reflect the quality of the cleaned observation files.
The content of the binary file may be viewed by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#REDISP">REDISP</a> or analyzed by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RESRMS">RESRMS</a>.

<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
and will be saved in the result files to document the program run.
The title should characterize the program run by, e.g., giving the most
important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="NFRCHK" default="AUTO"></a>
<a name="MINLEN" default="20"></a>
<b>GENERAL SETTINGS</b>
<p><b>Screening mode, frequency to check:</b>
This option is important for dual-band data. For baselines longer than about
10 to 20&nbsp;km the <b>COMBINED</b> mode (depending on the activity in the
ionosphere) is mandatory as only there the ionosphere-free
linear combination L3 of the L1 and L2 observations is used for cycle slip
detection. The <b>BOTH</b> mode actually consists only of the single frequency
preprocessing for L1 and L2 independently.
<br>
The selection <b>AUTO</b> automatically switches between the "BOTH" and the
"COMBINED" mode depending on the specification in the input field "Max.
baseline length to use BOTH mode". Single-frequency data are automatically
screened in the "BOTH"-mode when "AUTO" is selected.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
When processing zero-difference phase observation files
the "COMBINED" mode should be applied because the screening bases on the
Precise Point Positioning (PPP) method where the data of the single station
are joining a global network.

<p><i>Remark for kinematic stations:</i>
Observation files containing
kinematic stations where the positions have to be estimated should be
handled in the "COMBINED" mode when ever possible. Otherwise the reduced
degree of freedom (four parameters are estimated before the interpretation
of the residuals) increases the difficulty to distinguish between
the (real) influence from the ionosphere and data problems.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>AUTO</tt>

<p><b>Max. baseline length to use BOTH mode:</b>
If the "Screening mode, frequency to check" is automatically selected the
maximum length in km of a baseline that will be screened in the "BOTH" mode
is selected here. All longer baselines will be screened in the "COMBINED" mode.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>20</tt> km

<a name="SECIPL" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Interpolation of clocks: </b>
The interpolation of the satellite clocks may be applicable if you process data
with a higher sampling than the available satellite clocks, e.g. LEO data with
10 seconds sampling, satellite clocks with 30 seconds sampling. Then you can
linearly interpolate the clocks by selecting a value, which is larger than the
sampling of the clocks.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0</tt>

<a name="ISAVE" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Save screened observation files:</b>
Check this box to save the screened observation files for further use in the
program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>. If this box is left unmarked
all observation files remain untouched which means that all changes
suggested by the program are lost. Not saving modified observation files may
be useful for test purposes or for the generation of a priori coordinates from
the epoch-difference solution for a next MAUPRP iteration.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<!-- Option not in panel
<p><u>Take frequency/wavelength factors from file:</u>
It may happen that the selected options are not compatible with the files to
be preprocessed (e.g., number of frequencies in the observation files,
wave-length factors). If you mark this box, the necessary information is
taken from the observation header files.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<br><br>

<a name="TROPOS" default="GMF"></a>
<p><b>TROPOSPHERE MODELING</b>
<p><b>ZPD model and mapping function:</b>
There are several possibilities to model the tropospheric delay. The
models <b>GMF</b> and <b>VMF</b> as well as the older models <b>NIELL</b>, <b>SAASTAMOINEN</b>,
and <b>HOPFIELD</b> are including
the dry and wet component of the tropospheric delay, whereas the
models <b>DRY_GMF</b>, <b>DRY_VMF</b>, <b>DRY_NIELL</b>, <b>DRY_SAAST</b>, and <b>DRY_HOPFIELD</b>
take into account the dry part only.
<br>
Selecting <b>NONE</b> suppresses the use of an a priori troposphere model
and is therefore not recommended (for test purposes only). For LEO-satellites
no troposphere will be applied even if you have chosen a troposphere model
here.
<br>
The troposphere model is used corresponding to the selected input
files:
<ol>
<li>If no troposphere input files (input fields "Estimated troposphere values"
    and "Meteo data files" in the "INPUT FILES" section are empty) the selected
    troposphere model is used to compute the troposphere delay with extrapolated
    meteorological data based on a standard atmosphere.
    <br>
    In case of <b>VMF</b> or <b>DRY_VMF</b> the values from ECMWF as included in the
    grid files are used. If you have specified <b>GMF</b> or <b>DRY_GMF</b> the GPT
    (Global Pressure Temperature model,
    <href="REFERENCES.HLP#Boehm_etal_2007">B&ouml;hm et al, 2007</a>) is used as
    basis for the troposphere model.
    <br>
    In all other models, the starting values at
    sea level to compute pressure, temperature, and humidity at the height of
    the station (standard atmosphere) are given in the "General constants" file
    you have specified in the "GENERAL INPUT FILES" section. Do not change these
    values.
<li>If a file with estimated troposphere values from
    <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a> or
    <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a> has been
    selected in the field "Estimated  troposphere values" of the "INPUT FILES"
    section these values are applied to model the troposphere delay. If a
    station is missing in this file extrapolated meteorological data are used
    (see 1).
<li>If Meteo files with observed meteorological data have been selected in the
    field "Meteo data files" in the "INPUT FILES" section these Meteo data are
    used to compute the troposphere delay with the selected troposphere model.
    For all stations without Meteo data in the input files extrapolated
    meteorological data are used (see 1).
</ol>

<p><i>Remark:</i>
Please remember that you need to specify grid with correction
values covering the time interval of processing in the input field "Maps of
VMF1 coefficients" if you have selected "VMF" or "DRY_VMF".

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The troposphere modeling is not relevant if you
preprocess data for LEOs.

<a name="STAFIX" default=""></a>
<p><b>SAVING COORDINATES</b>
<p><b>Define the fixed station:</b>
This option is only relevant if coordinates estimated in the epoch-difference
solution from single-difference observation files (baselines) are stored in
a "Coordinate results" file (see section "RESULT FILES"). The station to be
kept fixed may be specified by the user.
<br>
If no station name (blank) or "AUTO" is specified the program will select a
station automatically. It is possible that more than one station will be
fixed in a network which is divided into two or more independent parts, but
only one station (belonging to a first part of the network) to be fixed may
be specified by the user. MAUPRP will fix additional stations for the
remaining parts automatically.

If you check this box, all the observations already marked (e.g., from a
previous run of MAUPRP or manually in the
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#SATMRK">SATMRK</a> program) will not be checked
anymore at any stage of the preprocessing and remain marked. If this

<p><b>Mark observations below an elevation of:</b>
Observations with low elevations are expected to be more corrupted by the
troposphere and by multipath. On the other hand the height component of
the station position may be better estimated if observations with low
elevations are used. All observations below the specified cut-off angle
are marked. They are neither checked by this program nor used by the
parameter estimation program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>.
There are separate input fields for terrestrial stations and LEO-satellites.

<a name="MNCONT" default="301"></a>
<p><b>Minimum time interval accepted for continuous observations:</b>
Short intervals of observations (a few epochs only) are in general
not important for the quality of the final solution. On the contrary,
small pieces of data might indicate tracking problems which might lead
to many new ambiguity parameters causing higher a posteriori mean
errors of the estimated parameters. It seems to be safer to mark these
short intervals. A time interval which covers approximately
10&nbsp;epochs is appropriate as input value.

<a name="MXHOLE" default="61"></a>
<p><b>Maximum gap accepted within continuous observations:</b>
It might happen that many observations are marked because they are not
accepted by the previous criterion although a closer look to the observations
shows that the cause are very small gaps in the data (e.g., just one epoch
missing). It makes sense, therefore, to accept data with such short gaps
still as 'continuous observations'. If there is a gap in the data larger
than the value specified here, the data will no longer be considered
'continuous' and the check for small data pieces (defined in the previous
options) will be applied.
A time interval about twice the sampling rate in the observation file is
appropriate as input value.

<p><b>MAUPRP 5: Non-Parametric Screening</b>

<a name="IPRNT1" default="SUMMARY"></a>
<p><b> GENERAL OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Extent of program output: </b>
Non-parametric screening is the first part of the preprocessing. You
can specify here how many details you want to print into the program output
file from this part of the preprocessing.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>SUMMARY</tt>

<a name="MXINTR" default="2"></a>
<p><b>Maximum time interval for polynomial fit:</b>
In the first step the program checks whether or not the assumption is
correct that the observations may be represented by a polynomial of degree
<i>q</i> - specified in the section "SCREENING ON DIFFERENT DIFFERENCE LEVELS"
below - within an interval of a few minutes. This is achieved by
checking whether or not the (<i>q</i>+1)-st derivative is zero within
3&nbsp;times its "Discontinuity level" to be specified in the section
"SCREENING ON DIFFERENT DIFFERENCE LEVELS". If the assumption is correct,
the considered interval is shifted by one observation. If the assumption
is wrong, the last observation of the current interval is marked an
replaced by the following one. If the current interval gets longer
than the specified value, all observations of this current interval
are dropped, and the process is re-initialized.
<br>
The interval has to be long enough to contain <i>q</i>+2 observation epochs
because the (<i>q</i>+1)-st derivative has to be computed. If a polynomial
degree of one is used (<i>q</i>=1), the interval has to contain at
least three observation epochs. It is not recommended to use a large maximal
interval of fit.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>2</tt>&nbsp;minutes for 30&nbsp;seconds
data sampling

<br><br>

<a name="IPPROC1" default="0"></a>
<p><b>SCREENING ON DIFFERENT DIFFERENCE LEVELS</b>
<p><b>Original observations from file:</b>
If you check this box the observations are fitted by a polynomial on the
zero-difference level if zero-difference observation files are specified or
on the single-difference level if single-difference files are specified.
This has the advantage that a problem may directly be assigned to a
specific satellite.
On the other hand the 'success' of the polynomial fit depends on the quality
of the receiver clock synchronization previously done in program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#CODSPP">CODSPP</a>. This screening is, therefore,
not used in general, except for debugging purposes.

<!--
<p><i>Remark:</i> Observations excluded in the non-parametric screening
algorithm will not contribute to the epoch-difference solution.
Nevertheless, they will finally be checked for cycle slips and outliers
to mark them definitively or not.

<a name="IPPROC2" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Differences between satellites</b>
It is recommended to use differences between satellites for the
non-parametric screening. The differences between two satellites of one
epoch are formed from the observations in the observation files (which
results in a single-difference screening if zero-difference observation
files are selected or in a double-difference screening if single-difference
files are specified). The advantage is that the receiver clock synchronization
previously done in the program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#CODSPP">CODSPP</a>
will not affect the polynomial fit.
Unmark this box only for debugging purposes.

<p><b>MAUPRP 6: Epoch-Difference Solution</b>

<a name="LTRIP" default="L3"></a>
<p><b>EPOCH-DIFFERENCE SOLUTION</b>
<p>
In the previous non-parametric screening step differences between two
satellites for the same epoch are formed from the measurements in the
observation files. In this step additional differences between two
successive epochs are formed from the satellite differences of the
observations. In the case of single difference observation files this
corresponds to a triple-difference solution.
<br>
The epoch-difference solution is used as reference for the cycle
slip detection and correction. It is, therefore, essential for a
successful preprocessing.

<p><b>Frequency for the solution:</b>
Specify the linear combination used for the epoch-difference solution.
The polynomial fit in the non-parametric screening part is done with
this linear combination, too.
<br>
For longer baselines, the ionosphere-free linear combination L3 is
the best choice.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>L3</tt>

<a name="KINSTA" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Kinematic coordinate estimation:</b>
If large receiver coordinate differences from epoch to epoch occur it is
possible to take the change of the position (zero-difference observation
file) or of the baseline vector (single-difference observation file) into
account. It is recommended to constrain the coordinates to the a priori
values (see option "A priori coordinate/baseline vector sigmas" below).
<br>
It is not necessary to mark this box if you have introduced very good
a priori kinematic positions (e.g., selecting "Kinematic input coordinates"
in the section "INPUT FILES") which are not expected to be improved by an
epoch-difference solution.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="OMCMAX" default="0.5"></a>
<p><b>Maximum observed-computed value:</b>
Observations which lead to epoch-difference residuals larger than the
specified value will not be used for the epoch-difference solution.
In the program output these observations will be marked with the flag
<tt>O-C</tt>. If you have bad a priori coordinates, you should not make
use of this parameter. Enter <tt>0.0</tt> or blank to disable the test.

<!---
<p><i>Remark:</i> Observations excluded by this threshold

<a name="RMSMAX" default="1.0"></a>
<p><b>RMS limit for epoch solution:</b>
In the case of zero-difference observation files or kinematic coordinate
estimation the change of the clock resp. the position is estimated epoch by
epoch. This estimation can be flagged as 'bad' if a high RMS remains after
removing bad observations. The limit for this RMS can be specified in this
input field. The occurrence of a high RMS will be reported as a warning
message.

<a name="SIGWGS2" default="0.1"></a>
<a name="SIGWGS3" default="0.1"></a>
<p><b>A priori coordinate/baseline vector sigmas</b>
A priori sigmas may be assigned to the station coordinates if you are
screening zero-difference phase observation file and to the baseline
vector if you have selected single-difference phase observation
files respectively. A value of zero
is equivalent to no a priori sigmas specified, i.e., the solution is not
constrained.
<br>
It is recommended to use these constraints if good a priori
coordinates are already available. The specified a priori sigmas should
approximately reflect the accuracy of the a priori coordinates.
<br>
If the "Kinematic coordinate estimation" is enabled the constraining
of the coordinates or baseline vectors will help to improve the reliability
of the epoch solutions and in this way the screening result. It is recommended
to introduce a priori kinematic positions (e.g., by selecting "Kinematic
input coordinates" in the section "INPUT FILES").

<p><b>MAUPRP 7: Clock Events</b>

<a name="CLKOPT2" default="50"></a>
<p><b>DETECTION OF CLOCK EVENTS</b>
<p>
In principle jumps in the receiver clock are uncritical. This is true if
such events are treated in a consistent way in the RINEX files. They affect
the observation epoch, the code, and the phase measurements with a
corresponding magnitude. The program <a href="CODSPP.HLP">CODSPP</a> needs to
be run before MAUPRP to synchronize the receiver clocks using
the code observations. In the epoch solutions of MAUPRP these code based
receiver clock values have to be confirmed using the phase observations.
If this is not the case MAUPRP will report a 'clock event'. It must be
identified and, if possible, corrected if code and phase observations are
introduced together into the program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>
for the estimation of clock corrections.
<br>
Some receivers generate jumps with a size of <i>n</i> times one millisecond.
If such ms-jumps are not correctly handled by receiver or RINEX converter
they may be repaired by MAUPRP.

<p><b>Minimum size of a clock event:</b>
MAUPRP uses the phase observations to estimate
the differences of the receiver clock from epoch to epoch. The a priori
values for this task stem from the <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">CODSPP</a>
solution. The estimate for the change of the receiver clock from epoch to
epoch is, therefore, expected to be zero.
<br>
The parameter in this field specifies the threshold above which the estimate
from the phase observations for the receiver clock differs from the a priori
values obtained from the pure code measurements is considered as a 'clock
event'.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>50</tt>&nbsp;nanoseconds

<a name="TOLJMP" default="0.001"></a>
<p><b>Tolerance for ms-jump detection:</b>
MAUPRP is able to identify ms-jumps with the magnitude of n times
1&nbsp;millisecond. A tolerance has to be defined to account for the
measurement noise. If the tolerance is too large, arbitrary clock estimates
may be interpreted as ms-jumps and the phase observations will be corrected
for this (wrong) clock offsets.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0.001</tt>&nbsp;milliseconds

<br><br>

<a name="CLKOPT5" default="0"></a>
<p><b>MS-JUMP HANDLING</b>
<p><b>Flag the observation file for deletion:</b>
If you check this box the program will stop the preprocessing for those
files for which a ms-jump is found. The screened phase observation file
will not be stored but flagged in the program output (<tt>#@# JUMP</tt>
instead of <tt>#@# OK</tt>). The extraction program
<a href="MPRXTR.HLP">MPRXTR</a> may then be used to write a file deletion
list containing these corrupted files.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="CLKOPT1" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Repair the ms-jumps as 'cycle slips':</b>
The ms-jumps may be repaired in the observation files. Assuming that
they have a magnitude of a multiple of a millisecond it is possible to
correct them in the same way as cycle slips. If the option is disabled the
ms-jumps will be treated according to the options for "HANDLING OF OTHER CLOCK
EVENTS" below.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<br><br>

<a name="CLKOPT6" default="0"></a>
<p><b>HANDLING OF OTHER CLOCK EVENTS</b>

(<tt>#@# CLKP</tt> instead of <tt>#@# OK</tt>). The
extraction program <a href="MPRXTR.HLP">MPRXTR</a> may then be used to write
a file deletion list containing these corrupted files.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="CLKOPT3" default="300"></a>
<p><b>Mark observations up to a time interval:</b>
If several clock events occur within a time interval specified by this
option, the magnitude of all these events are summed up. If this sum is
below the limit specified in the field "Minimum size of a clock
event" it can be assumed that the receiver clock problem affects a
few epochs only. These epochs are marked to eliminate the clock event.
<br>
Approximately 10&nbsp;epochs is a reasonable value here. You may use the
same value as for "Minimum observed time interval per ambiguity" in the
section "MARKING OF OBSERVATIONS AFTER CYCLE SLIP CORRECTIONS".

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>300</tt>&nbsp;seconds for 30&nbsp;seconds data

<a name="CLKOPT4" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Set ambiguities for all satellites:</b>
In general, clock events can be handled by introducing new ambiguities for
the phase observations of all satellites at the corresponding epochs. This
is the save way to treat clock events.

<p><i>Caution:</i>
Unmark this box only for very special test purposes:
In this case you will <b>not</b> be able to process code and phase

<p><b>Do not accept cycle slip corrections:</b>
If a cycle slip was detected the program tries to correct it. The cycle slip
corrections are directly applied to the observations. If you check this box
you will suppress the correction. No cycle slip correction obtained from the
algorithm will be accepted (which is equivalent to set the option
"Minimum size of accepted cycle slip correction" to infinity).
<br>
If you are preprocessing zero-difference observation files it is in
general not recommended to apply any cycle slip correction.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked for preprocessing of single-difference

<a name="MINCYC" default="10"></a>
<p><b>Minimum size of accepted cycle slip correction:</b>
Cycle slips smaller than the value specified in this field are considered as
outliers and are marked. Small cycle slips in the data (up to about
10&nbsp;cycles) might not be real.
<br>
This option reduces the probability that a cycle slip is introduced into
the data due to a high noise level (e.g., for low elevation data).

<p><i>Default value:</i><tt> 10</tt>&nbsp;cycles

Check this box only if you use dual-band P-code receivers and if you know

<a name="SIGL12_2" default="0.0020"></a>
<p><b>NO CYCLE SLIP HYPOTHESIS</b>
<p><b>Sigma for L1 observations</b>/<b>Sigma for L2 observations:</b>
These parameters have to be set only if the data are screened by the
"COMBINED" method (see option "Screening mode, frequency to check" in
the section "GENERAL SETTINGS"). They are first
used to check the no-cycle-slip hypothesis for each individual epoch
difference by comparing it with the epoch-difference solution. If a cycle
slip is identified the parameters are used again to check if there are
cycle slip corrections within the search range specified in the option, e.g.,
"Search width to find L1 cycle slip correction" below meeting the
no-cycle-slip hypothesis. If the second step is not successful the
cycle slip is not repaired.
<br>
The sigma values have an essential effect on the cycle slip detection
algorithm. If you specify a too large value (compared to the actual noise),
the algorithm will find more than one acceptable possibility to correct the
cycle slip in L1 and/or L2 at some epochs. Therefore, the cycle slip
correction candidate with the smallest ionosphere change will be chosen
which is not necessary the correct one, especially on long baselines.
If you specify a too small value, the program will not find any suitable
choice at certain epochs and will mark a lot of observations or introduce
many ambiguity parameters.
<br>
The sigmas should be chosen within the limits
0.0008&nbsp;m&nbsp;-&nbsp;0.0015&nbsp;m (corresponding to about 2.2&nbsp;cm
and 4.0&nbsp;cm for the triple-difference L3 residuals for epoch-differences
of single-difference observation files) and according to the quality of the
receivers. Because the narrow-lane linear combination (with a wavelength of
approximately 10&nbsp;cm) plays an important role in the preprocessing, a
sigma value larger than 0.0018&nbsp;m will allow small cycle slip to pass
unnoticed.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If low elevation data is used the sigma values may
nevertheless be set to 0.0020&nbsp;m. In this case screening of the
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a> residuals is,
however, mandatory to remove remaining data problems at low elevations. This
has to be done using the <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RESRMS">RESRMS</a> and
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#SATMRK">SATMRK</a> programs.
<br>
When preprocessing zero-difference observation files the quality of the
introduced "Satellite clocks" (see section "INPUT FILES") may limit the sigma
for the observations. If the satellite clocks are too noisy you have to increase
the sigma values. In this case a screening of GPSEST residuals is mandatory,
too. To have the capability to detect all cycle slips the satellite clocks
need to have an epoch-to-epoch accuracy of 0.13&nbsp;ns (corresponds
to 4&nbsp;cm).
<br>
The sigma for L1 is used as the a priori unit of weight when a priori
sigmas for the station coordinates are applied (option "A priori
coordinate/baseline vector sigmas" in the section "EPOCH-DIFFERENCE SOLUTION").

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0.0020</tt>&nbsp;m if low elevation data is used
and residuals from GPSEST are screened.

<p><b>Maximum ionospheric change from epoch to epoch:</b>
You have to specify the maximum ionosphere change on the epoch difference
level (in % of the L1 wavelength, from one epoch to the next). A value
of about <tt>400</tt>% may be appropriate for very long baselines, i.e., less
than one L5 cycle. For shorter baselines smaller values may be used.
Do not use values smaller than <tt>50</tt>% in the
"COMBINED" mode (see option "Screening mode, frequency to check" in the
section "GENERAL SETTINGS").
<br>
A linear increasing value for this parameter depending on the baseline
length seems to be reasonable: Starting from the values for short baselines
(e.g., <tt>30</tt>% assumed for a baseline length of <tt>0</tt> km) up to
the value for long baselines (e.g., <tt>400</tt>%) for a user defined
baseline length (e.g., <tt>2000</tt>km, see <b>use the combined mode value
for bsl longer than</b>) this parameter is linearly increased
whereas for longer baselines the maximum value for long baselines is used.
<br>
If you are not running the "COMBINED" mode the change of the ionosphere
between two epochs cannot exceed half a wavelength to be sure that
all cycle slips will be detected. A value of <tt>30</tt>% seems to be
reasonable.
