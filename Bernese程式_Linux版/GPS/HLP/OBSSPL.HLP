<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
The program OBSSPL splits a Bernese observation file into two files based on
a user specified epoch or epoch number, creates a header file for the second
observation file and modifies the first header file accordingly. Several
files may be split in one program run, e.g., corresponding code and phase
files, or all observation files of a session.

<p><b>OBSSPL 1: Input and Output Files</b>

<a name="SHOWGEN" default="1"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL FILES</b>
<p><b>Show all general files:</b>
Check this box to get a list of the general input files used by this program
as well as the currently active campaign, session, and session table.

<br><br>

<a name="OBSTYPE" default="GNSS"</a>
<a name="CZHFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>OBSERVATION FILES</b>
Select whether microwave (GNSS) or SLR (Range) observation files should
be considered.

<p><b>Zero diff.</b> <b>code:</b>
Select a list of headers of code zero difference files. All the
corresponding observation files will be split and the headers will be modified
accordingly. If you want to use other types of observation files only, this field 
has to remain empty.

<a name="PZHFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Zero diff.</b> <b>phase:</b>
Select a list of headers of phase zero difference files. All the
corresponding observation files will be split and the headers will be modified
accordingly. If you want to use other types of observation files only, this field 
has to remain empty.

<a name="BOTHZERO" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Zero diff.</b> <b>both:</b>
Check this box if you have code and phase zero difference files with identical
names that you like to split in one run. The selection lists from
the code and phase zero difference files will be merged and the files
for both types of observations will be processed.

<a name="CSHFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Single diff.</b> <b>code:</b>
Select a list of headers of code single difference files. All the
corresponding observation files will be split and the headers will be modified
accordingly. If you want to use other types of observation files only, this field 
has to remain empty.

<a name="PSHFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Single diff.</b> <b> phase:</b>
Select a list of headers of phase single difference files. All the
corresponding observation files will be split and the headers will be modified
accordingly. If you want to use other types of observation files only, this field 
has to remain empty.

<a name="BOTHSING" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Single diff.</b> <b>both:</b>
Check this box if you have code and phase single difference files with
identical names that you like to split in one run. The selection lists from
the code and phase single difference files will be merged and the files
for both types of observations will be processed.

<a name="RZHFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Range:</b>
Select a list of headers of range observation files. All the
corresponding observation files will be split and the headers will be modified
accordingly.

<a name="SYSODEF" default="1"></a>
<a name="SYSOUT"  default="OBSSPL"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the year
and day of year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<br><br>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
to document the program run. The title should characterize the program run by,
e.g., giving the most important options used and the session.

<p><b>OBSSPL 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="CONST" default="CONST."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>General constants:</b>
This file contains all the physical and astronomical constants used
in the Bernese GNSS Software. Most probably you will never have to
modify this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">$X/GEN/CONST.</a>

<br><br>

<a name="AUXFIL"  default="OBSSPL$J"></a>
<p><b>TEMPORARY FILES</b>
<p>
Enter the names of the scratch file used by this program. The scratch file needs
to be named differently for different programs running simultaneously. This
may be achieved, e.g., by adding the job ID
<tt>$J</tt> to the program name (define the job ID in the dialogue
<a href="SETDATE.HLP">Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Set session/compute day</a>).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>OBSSPL$J</tt>

<p><hr>

<p><b>OBSSPL 2: Options</b>

<a name="FILNEW" default=""></a>
<p><b>OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Second obs. file or last char.:</b>
You have to specify a filename for the second observation file. You may
specify either a new filename with up to 8 characters or a single character
which defines the last character of the new filename
(e.g., <tt>A</tt> for <tt>ZIMM213A.CZH</tt>).
<br>
If you specify a new filename of 8 characters, make sure that you have
selected only one observation file for each observation type!

<p><i>Caution:</i>
The input file(s) will be modified in any case. Be aware
that already existing observation files with the name of the second file will
be <i>overwritten</i> without any message.

<a name="RADIO_1" default="0"></a>
<a name="OBSNUM" default=""></a>
<p><b>Split observation number:</b>
Specify the observation number where the observation file has to be split.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The epoch corresponding to
an epoch number depends on the reference epoch of the observation files.
If this reference epoch is different for the selected observation files
you will split them at different epochs.

<a name="RADIO_2" default="1"></a>
<a name="STADAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="STATIM" default="00 00 00"></a>
<p><b>Split time:</b>
Specify the observation epoch where the observation files have to be split.
