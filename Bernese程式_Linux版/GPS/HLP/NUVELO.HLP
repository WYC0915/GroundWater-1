<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
The purpose of program NUVELO is to compute station velocities based on
the NUVEL-1 no-net-rotation plate motion model. If a site is not available
in the list of ITRF coordinates and velocities the NUVEL velocities serve as
good estimates for station velocities. The program supports the no-net
rotation plate models NUVEL-1 (<a href="REFERENCES.HLP#Argus1991">Argus
and Gordon, 1991</a>) and NUVEL-1A (<a href="REFERENCES.HLP#DeMets1994">DeMets
et al., 1994</a>).
<br>
The user may select a subset of, or all, the stations contained in an input
coordinate file. Based on a plate definition file, the program computes the
velocities of the selected stations. If the station name is not contained in
the plate definition model, a zero velocity vector results. The obtained
velocities for the selected stations are merged into an a priori velocity
file. Velocities for stations contained in this file will be overwritten.
The stations for which plate velocities are computed are marked with the flag
<tt>V</tt>.

<p><b>NUVELO 1: Input/Output Files</b>

<a name="SHOWGEN" default="1"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL FILES</b>
<p><b>Show all general files:</b>
Check this box to get a list of the general input files used by this program
as well as the currently active campaign, session, and session table.

<br><br>

<a name="COORD" default=""></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILE</b>
<p><b>Input coordinate file:</b>
Plate velocities may be computed only for stations contained in this
coordinate file.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.CRD">Example</a>

<a name="VELAPR" default=""></a>
<p><b>Input velocity file:</b>
This input file is used as a template velocity file only.
Velocities for stations for which no plate
velocities are computed will be copied into the "Output velocity file".
<br>
If you do not want to use a template, leave this input field empty.
The "Output velocity file" will then only contain the stations you selected
in the "STATION SELECTION" section.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
Plate information in this velocity file will not be used
for the plate assignment in this program. You have to use the "Plate definition
file" in any case.
<br>
<a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.VEL">Example</a>

<a name="VELTRN" default=""></a>
<p><b>Plate definition file:</b>
The file should contain an entry for each
station for which a plate velocity shall be computed. It assigns the stations
to a tectonic plate.
<p>
The subroutines to compute the station velocities are NUVEL1 and NUVELA.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The plate ID must correspond to the table <a href="PLATES.HLP">here</a>.
<br>
If a station is assigned to an unknown plate (i.e., not contained in this
list) it will obtain a zero velocity vector.

<br><br>

<a name="VELORS" default=""></a>
<p><b>RESULT FILE</b>
<p><b>Output velocity file:</b>
Select the name of the velocity result file. It will contain the velocities
derived from plate motions for all selected stations for which a plate
definition is given. The velocities will be marked with a flag 'V'. Selected
stations for which no plate is defined will obtain a velocity vector of zero.
The file is filled with the remaining stations with their respective
velocities from the "Input velocity file" if you have selected one in the
"INPUT FILE" section above.

<a name="SYSODEF" default="1"></a>
<a name="SYSOUT"  default="NUVELO"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
year and day of year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<p><b>NUVELO 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="CONST" default="CONST."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>General constants:</b>
This file contains all the physical and astronomical constants used
in the Bernese GNSS Software. Most probably you will never have to
modify this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">$X/GEN/CONST.</a>

<a name="DATUM" default="DATUM."></a>
<p><b>Geodetic datum:</b>
This file contains the definition of the geodetic datum and of the
ellipsoid to be used to compute ellipsoidal coordinates. It is used
to apply antenna heights and for the printing of coordinates in the
local system (north, east, up). You only have to modify this file
when you want to introduce a new reference ellipsoid.

<p><i>Caution:</i>
This file has no effect on Cartesian coordinates.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/DATUM.">$X/GEN/DATUM.</a>

<br><br>

<a name="AUXFIL" default="NUVELO$J"></a>
<p><b>TEMPORARY FILES</b>
<p><b>Scratch file:</b>
Enter the name of the scratch file used by this program. The scratch file needs
to be named differently for different programs running simultaneously. This
may be achieved, e.g., by adding the job ID
<tt>$J</tt> to the program name (define the job ID in the dialogue
<a href="SETDATE.HLP">Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Set session/compute day</a>).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>NUVELO$J</tt>

<p><hr>

<p><b>NUVELO 2: Options</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
to document the program run. The title should characterize the program run by,
e.g., giving the most important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="STASEL" default="MANUAL"></a>
<a name="STALST" default="">
<p><b>STATION SELECTION</b>
<p><b>Select stations for output file:</b>
Specify <tt>ALL</tt> to compute velocities for all stations contained in the
input coordinate file or <tt>MANUAL</tt> to select a subset of stations only.

<a name="VELSTA" default=""></a>
<p><b>Stations for velocity computation:</b>
Select the stations for which velocities based on plate motions should be
computed.

<br><br>

<a name="MODEL" default="NUVEL1A"></a>
<p><b>OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Velocity model:</b>
Two no-net rotation plate models are supported, NUVEL-1 (Argus and Gordon,
1991), and NUVEL-1A (DeMets, Gordon, Argus, Stein, 1994). The two models are
implemented in the subroutines NUVEL1.f and NUVEL1A.f. For reference see
the USNO Circular 167 'Project Merit Standards' by Tony Mallama.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>NUVEL1A</tt>
