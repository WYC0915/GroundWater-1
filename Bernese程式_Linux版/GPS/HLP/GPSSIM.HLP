<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
The program GPSSIM allows to create simulated GPS and/or GLONASS data that
can be processed by the Bernese GNSS Software. Code and phase files may be
created. Observation files for one session are created per
program run. An entire simulated campaign may be created with several program
runs.
<br>
The following input files define the scope of your observation
scenario:
<br>
<ul>
<li>a standard orbit file is used to compute satellite positions,
<li>two Bernese clock files are used to apply satellite resp. receiver
    clock corrections, and
<li>the coordinate file defines the station coordinates.
</ul>
The Bernese satellite clock files and the standard orbit file should cover
approximately the same time interval. Observations will only be created for
the time span covered in the standard orbit file, and only for the stations
given in the coordinate file (even LEOs have to be listed in the coordinate
file).
<br>
The options and input files you are using in
GPSSIM have to be the same as those you will use in the following processing
programs like, e.g.,
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#CODSPP">CODSPP</a>, <a href="PGMLST.HLP#SNGDIF">SNGDIF</a>,
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#MAUPRP">MAUPRP</a>, <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>,
and <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a> if you want to do the
'zero test'. Otherwise you may do well defined changes in the options to
investigate their influence on a solution.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
In the case of combined simulation of GPS and GLONASS
data there is no receiver time bias between both satellite systems applied.

<p><b>GENERAL FILES</b>
<p><b>Show all general files:</b>
Check this box to get a list of the general input files used by this program
as well as the currently active campaign, session, and session table.

<br><br>

<a name="STDORB" default=""></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>GNSS Standard orbit:</b>
Selection of a standard orbit file which covers the time span you
want to simulate data for.

<a name="POLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>Pole file:</b>
This file contains the Earth rotation parameters (ERP's). It is used for
the transformations between the International Celestial Reference Frame
(ICRF) and the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). This
file has to be identical to the one used for the computation of the standard
orbit.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ERP">Example</a>

<a name="COORD" default=""></a>
<p><b>Coordinate file:</b>
Selection of a coordinate file. This coordinate file must
contain all the sites you are processing (including LEOs).

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.CRD">Example</a>

<a name="KININP" default=""></a>
<p><b>Kin.inp. coordinates:</b>
To simulate observations for kinematic stations it is possible
to introduce kinematic coordinates, e.g., generated by program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.KIN">Example</a>

<a name="TROPEST" default=""></a>
<p><b>Est.troposphere val.:</b>
You may introduce a file with troposphere estimates from
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>
or <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a>.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.TRP">Example</a>

<a name="METFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Meteo data files:</b>
Measured surface meteorological data may be used to
compute the tropospheric zenith delays. One meteorological data file
per station has to be specified. These
meteo data are used to compute the troposphere delay with the model selected
in option "ZPD model and mapping function" of the section "TROPOSPHERE
MODELING".

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE1.MET">Example1</a>,
   <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE2.MET">Example2</a>,
   <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE3.MET">Example3</a>

<a name="VMF1_FILES" default=""></a>
<p><b>Maps of VMF1 coeff.:</b>
To choose the Vienna Mapping Function VMF1
(see <a href="REFERENCES.HLP#Boehm2004">B&ouml;hm et al, 2004)</a>
several coefficients are needed.
These files can be downloaded from yearly subdirectories
(see <a href="LINKS.HLP#VMF1">VMF1</a>). There are provided grid
files every 6&nbsp;hours. You may either select a set of grid files covering
the full time span of the data processed or you may also copy all these files
together into one file that is specified here.
<br>
To select a proper grid file here is the pre-requirement for choosing
<tt>VMF</tt> for "ZPD model and mapping function" in panel "GPSSIM 3.2:
Simulation Options".

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMP_VMF1.GRD">Example</a>

<a name="SATCLK" default=""></a>
<p><b>Satellite clocks:</b>
Select a satellite clock file (Bernese format) which covers the time
span you want to simulate data for. If no file is specified no satellite clock
corrections will be applied to the simulated data.
<br>
It is recommended to introduce a satellite clock file with a polynomial
model of the clocks because you will get no simulated data for an epoch
where the satellite clock is missing.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE1.CLK">Example</a>

<a name="RECCLK" default=""></a>
<p><b>Receiver clocks:</b>
Select a receiver clock file (Bernese format) which covers the time
span you want to simulate data for. If no file is specified no receiver clock
corrections will be applied to the simulated data.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE2.CLK">Example</a>

<a name="DCBINP" default=""></a>
<p><b>Code bias input file:</b>
Selection of a code bias input file containing differential
(<nobr>P1-P2</nobr> or <nobr>P1-C1</nobr>) code biases of satellites
(and receivers) is generally recommended. These biases are irrelevant only when
processing the L3 linear combination of code measurements from
P1/P2 (not C1/X2 or C1/P2) receivers. The characteristics
of your <nobr><tt>SIMULA</tt>-receiver</nobr> you have to define in the
"Receiver information" file to be specified in the "GENERAL INPUT FILES"
section.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.DCB">Example</a>

<a name="ANTAZI" default=""></a>
<p><b>Antenna orientations:</b>
Selection of a receiver antenna orientation file containing the
azimuth of the antenna orientations for each session, where any of
the antennas was not oriented to the north. This file is of special
use if you have to process antenna calibration campaigns, where the
antennas were oriented differently from session to session.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.AZI">Example</a>

<a name="IONOS" default=""></a>
<p><b>Ionosphere models:</b>
Observations for both frequencies are simulated and
written into the Bernese observation files. The ionosphere delay is the most
important difference between the simulated measurements of the two frequencies
(other differences may be, e.g., the noise and the
antenna phase center offsets).  Select an ionosphere
file containing local or global/regional ionosphere models to introduce this
influence to the simulated data.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If you plan to analyze the simulated data with the
ionosphere free linear combination (L3) only this input file is not
important for you.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE2.ION">Example</a>

<a name="OCNLOAD" default=""></a>
<p><b>Ocean loading corr.:</b>
Optionally a file containing the ocean loading amplitudes and phases may be
specified. The format is the de facto IERS standard.
<br>
The file becomes mandatory if you use a Standard orbit with CMC applied.
Be sure to select the same file as for the programs used to generate the
orbit file.

<p><i>Note:</i>:
For instructions on how to get ocean loading coefficients
for a set of (new) points please be referred to
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_BLQ.TXT">IGS Mail 3521</a>.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.BLQ">Example</a>

<a name="ATMLOAD" default=""></a>
<p><b>Atmospheric load. cor.:</b>
A file with atmospheric tidal loading corrections may be selected to correct
the simulated observations for this effect.
<br>
The file becomes mandatory if you use a Standard orbit with CMC applied.
Be sure to select the same file as for the programs used to generate the
orbit file.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
This file can be generated by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GRDS1S2">GRDS1S2</a>

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ATL">Example</a>

<a name="ALOAD_FILES" default=""></a>
<a name="ONTLD_FILES" default=""></a>
<a name="HLOAD_FILES" default=""></a>
<p><b>Vienna grid files:</b>
Geometrical deformations of the Earth crust from any source can be introduced
as corrections for the station coordinates (analogue like solid Earth tides).
They are expected in global grids in the same format as the components of the
VMF. You have the opportunity to introduce three different sets of corrections
where the keyword <tt>! Data_types:</tt> is used to identify which type of
correction is expected in this particular file. The following keywords
correspond to the three types of corrections:
<ul>
<li>Atmospheric press.load: <tt>ATM-NT-LOAD</tt>
<li>Ocean non-tidal load: <tt>OCN-NT-LOAD</tt>
<li>Hydrostatic press.load: <tt>HYDR-LOAD</tt>
</ul>
Note that the program accepts only input files with the expected keywords in
the input field.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The name "Vienna grid files" indicates only that the same
format as for the VMF corrections is used. It does not mean that the files
must be provided by the TU Vienna.

<p><i>Remark for advanced users:</i>
The values from the grid files are
simply applied to the coordinates. It means you can put any geometrical
corrections in one of these files.

<a name="SYSODEF" default="1"></a>
<a name="SYSOUT"  default="GPSSIM"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<br><br>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
and will be saved in all the simulated observation files to document the
program run.
The title should characterize the program run by, e.g., giving the most
important options used and the session.

<p><b>GPSSIM 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="CONST" default="CONST."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>General constants:</b>
This file contains all the physical and astronomical constants used
in the Bernese GNSS Software. Most probably you will never have to
modify this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">$X/GEN/CONST.</a>

<a name="DATUM" default="DATUM."></a>
<p><b>Geodetic datum:</b>
This file contains the definition of the geodetic datum and of the
ellipsoid to be used to compute ellipsoidal coordinates. It is used
to apply antenna heights and for the printing of coordinates in the
local system (north, east, up). You only have to modify this file
when you want to introduce a new reference ellipsoid.

<p><i>Caution:</i>
This file has no effect on Cartesian coordinates.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/DATUM.">$X/GEN/DATUM.</a>

<a name="SUBMOD" default="IERS2010XY"></a>
<p><b>Subdaily pole model:</b>
This file contains the parameters for the subdaily pole model. It
has to be identical to the one used for the computation of the
standard orbit.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/IERS2010XY.SUB">$X/GEN/IERS2010XY.SUB</a>

<a name="NUTMOD" default="IAU2000R06"></a>
<p><b>Nutation model:</b>
This file contains the parameters for the nutation model. It
has to be identical to the one used for the computation of the
standard orbit.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/IAU2000R06.NUT">$X/GEN/IAU2000R06.NUT</a>

<a name="SATELL" default="SATELLIT.I08"></a>
<p><b>Satellite information:</b>
This file contains general information on GNSS (and LEO/GEO) satellites.
For the session to be processed,
each satellite has to appear once in this file
within a corresponding time window.

<p><i>Note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/SATELLIT. is maintained by AIUB/CODE.
It includes a complete history concerning the GPS satellite constellation
(and newly launched satellites are regularly added).
You can get the latest version of this file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08</a>

<a name="RECEIVR" default="RECEIVER."></a>
<p><b>Receiver information:</b>
This file contains in essence the code measurement types for a list of
receivers. These specifications are relevant when considering so-called
differential (P1-P2 or P1-C1) code biases.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
Do not forget to enter the receiver names for the
simulated stations. The six first characters are <tt>SIMULA</tt> in any case.
The remaining characters for the receiver names are given in the input
field <tt>Receiver</tt> in the "OBSERVATION HEADER FILE INFORMATION" part.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/RECEIVER.">$X/GEN/RECEIVER.</a>

<a name="PHASECC" default="PCV.I08"></a>
<p><b>Phase center offsets:</b>
This file contains receiver antenna phase center offsets and optionally
elevation-dependent phase center patterns.
In addition, the file may contain satellite-specific antenna
phase center patterns (dependent on nadir angle) as well as offset values.
Corresponding offset (correction) values, however, are not yet considered
by the software.
The satellite antenna offset values applied correspond to
those given in <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08</a>.
<br>
You have to modify this file when you use a new antenna type
or when you wish to consider your own PCV calibrations.
The program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ATX2PCV">ATX2PCV</a> allows to convert
PCV information given in ANTEX format into Bernese-formatted PCV tables.

<p><i>Important note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.REL contains PCV values
for most of the receiver antenna types commonly used
within IGS (and EUREF).
These PCV values are addressed as 'relative' values
as they are generally referred to
a specific receiver antenna type (AOAD/M_T).
For this reference antenna type
(as well as implicitly all GNSS antenna types),
PCV patterns are assumed to be nonexistent.
Sooner or later, it will become common to consider 'absolutely' calibrated
receiver and satellite antenna PCV values.
A corresponding file ($X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.ABS) will be made available
as soon as this is the case.

<a name="SATCRUX" default="SAT_$Y+0"></a>
<p><b>Satellite problems:</b>
This file contains information on satellite problems concerning modeling.
It is used for exclusion of misbehaving satellites
(and for orbit arc splitting).
It may also contain (mean) epochs of GPS repositioning events.

<p><b>Abbreviation table:</b>
This file contains a station name abbreviation table containing
<nobr>4-character</nobr>
and <nobr>2-character</nobr> abbreviations for a list of station names.
The <nobr>4-character</nobr> station name abbreviations are used to generate the
zero-difference observation filenames in GPSSIM.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The names of the observation files in Bernese format are
generated automatically. Therefore, please take care, that all stations
you want to process have different <nobr>4-character</nobr> abbreviations.
Otherwise the observation files may be overwritten.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ABB"> Example</a>

<a name="STAINFO" default=""></a>
<p><b>Station information:</b>

<a name="FRQINFO" default=""></a>
<p><b>Frequency information:</b>
This file contains the frequency information (frequency value, measurement
type, frequency number) for all observation types. Entries are specified by the
measurement type, the satellite or station name, and the duration of validity.
Currently, it is used for range measurements (SLR) only.
The frequency value is needed for the MARINI-MURRAY troposphere model,
used for SLR data analysis.

<p><b>OBSERVATION WINDOW</b>
<p>
The following fields allow to specify the time window for which
observations shall be simulated. You can define the time window either by
using session definitions, or by explicitly specifying start and end times.

<p><b>Defined by year and session identifier:</b>
You may specify one session from the <a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session table</a>.
The boundaries of this session define the observation window. If you use an
open session table the year has to be specified in addition to the session
identifier. If you use a fixed session table the year is read from the session
definition and the value in the panel is ignored.
<br>
It is possible to specify a range of sessions using the corresponding
menu variable (<tt>$S+-</tt>). In this case the time window starts at the
beginning of the first session of the range and stops at the end of the last
session of the range. If you use an open session table the year should also
be given with the range variable (<tt>$Y+-</tt>). The first session identifier
from the list is used for the naming of the Bernese observation files and
it will be written into the Bernese observation file header for later use in the
programs <a href="PGMLST.HLP#SNGDIF">SNGDIF</a> and
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>.

In the input fields you have to select more information
to be entered into the Bernese observation header file for the simulated data:
<ul>
<li><b>Receiver type</b>: To the receiver name you specify here the

<b>SAASTAMOINEN</b> and <b>HOPFIELD</b> are including the dry and
the wet component of the tropospheric delay, whereas the models
<b>DRY_GMF</b>, <b>DRY_VMF</b>, <b>DRY_NIELL</b>, <b>DRY_SAAST</b>
and <b>DRY_HOPFIELD</b>
take into account the dry part only.
<br>
Selecting <b>NONE</b> suppresses the use of an a priori troposphere model and
is therefore not recommended (for test purposes only). For LEO-satellites
no troposphere will be applied even if you have chosen a troposphere model
here.
<br>
The troposphere model is used corresponding to the selected input
files:
<ol>
<li>If no troposphere input files (input fields "Est.troposphere val." and
    "Meteo data files" in the "INPUT FILES" section are empty) the selected
    troposphere model is used to compute the troposphere delay with
    extrapolated meteorological data based on a standard atmosphere.
    <br>
    In case of <b>VMF</b> or <b>DRY_VMF</b> the values from ECMWF as included
    in the grid files are used.
    If you have specified <b>GMF</b> or <b>DRY_GMF</b> the GPT
    (Global Pressure Temperature model,
    <a href="REFERENCES.HLP#Boehm_etal_2007">B&ouml;hm et al, 2007</a>)
    is used as basis for the troposphere model.
    <br>
    In all other models, the starting values at
    sea level to compute pressure, temperature, and humidity at the height of
    the station (standard atmosphere) are given in the "General constants" file
    you have specified in the "GENERAL INPUT FILES" section. Do not change these
    values.
<li>If a file with estimated troposphere values from
    <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a> or
    <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a> has been
    selected in the field "Est.troposphere val." of the "INPUT FILES" section
    these values are applied to model the troposphere delay. If a station
    is missing in this file extrapolated meteorological data are used (see 1).
<li>If meteo files with observed meteorological data have been selected in the
    field "Meteo data files" in the "INPUT FILES" section these meteo data are
    used to compute the troposphere delay with the selected troposphere model.
    For all stations without meteo data in the input files extrapolated
    meteorological data are used (see 1).
</ol>
<p><i>Remark:</i>
Please remember that you need to specify grids with correction
values covering the time interval of processing in the input field "Maps of
VMF1 coeff." if you have selected "VMF" or "DRY_VMF".

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The troposphere modeling is not relevant if you preprocess data for LEOs.

<p><b>IONOSPHERE MODELING</b>
<p>
The deterministic part of the ionosphere may be applied to the simulated
observations by specifying a global ionosphere model in option "Ionosphere
models" on the "INPUT FILES" panel. Alternatively night time and day time
electron content of a very simple single layer model may be specified.
The following two options are only active if no ionosphere model is specified.

<p><b>Night time electron number:</b>
The night time electron number takes the specified constant value for local
times between 8pm and 8am.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0</tt>

<p><b>Day time electron number:</b>
This value specifies the amplitude of a cosine-shaped variation of the
electron number added to the night time electron number between 8am and 20pm
local time. For details see the documentation of the Bernese GNSS Software.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0</tt>

<a name="IONO3" default="0"></a>
<a name="IONREF" default=""></a>
<p><b>STOCHASTIC IONOSPHERE MODELING</b>
<p><b>Variance of irreg. change of ionosphere content:</b>
In addition to a deterministic component an irregular part may be superposed
which is modeled as a random walk depending on the baseline length up to a
distance of 200 km. The value entered in this field specifies the variation
of the ionosphere electron content in 1&nbsp;minute at 200 km distance from
the reference point. For details see the documentation of the Bernese GNSS
Software. A value of <tt>0</tt> disables the option.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0</tt>

<p><b>Reference station:</b>
Specify the reference station to which the ionosphere irregularities
refer. Preferentially a station near the center of the simulated network is
selected.

<p><i>Default value:</i> blank

<p><b>STATISTICAL INFORMATION</b>
<p>
You have the possibility to simulate error-free GPS observations in
which case you have to specify <tt>0.0</tt> in the fields for the a priori
sigmas or leave the input field blank.
Otherwise specify the a priori sigmas in meters in the corresponding
fields. Normally distributed noise will then be added to the observations
using a random number generator.  You may select the a priori sigmas
separately for stations and LEOs.
<ul>
<li><b>A priori sigma code L1:</b>
    This value gives the a priori sigma of the code observations on frequency
    L1.
<li><b>A priori sigma code L2:</b>
    This value gives the a priori sigma of the code observations on frequency
    L2.
<li><b>A priori sigma phase L1:</b>
    This value gives the a priori sigma of the phase observations on frequency
    L1.
<li><b>A priori sigma phase L2:</b>
    This value gives the a priori sigma of the phase observations on frequency
    L2.
</ul>

<p><i>Default values:</i> <tt>0.500</tt>&nbsp;meters for code and
                       <tt>0.002</tt>&nbsp;meters for phase observations

<a name="IXNUM" default="111"></a>
<p><b>Initial integer random number:</b> This integer number specifies the
initialization for the algorithm generating the random numbers. The option
allows to exactly reproduce a simulation.

<a name="ICOELV" default="1"></a>
<a name="LEOELV" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Elevation-dependent sigmas:</b>
Check this box if the observation data
shall be simulated with elevation-dependent sigmas. The a priori sigmas
specified in the above fields then refer to an observation in the zenith.
The a priori sigma of observations at a zenith angle z will then be computed
using the factor 1/cos(z).
