<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
The program FMTOBS converts formatted ASCII Bernese observation files
back into binary observation files. The program allows the conversion of
a number of observation files in one run and is mainly intended for observation
file transfer between different computer systems using different binary
formats: The files are first converted to ASCII using the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#OBSFMT">OBSFMT</a>,
then transferred to the target computer, and finally reconverted from ASCII
into binary using this program.
<br>
Values in the ASCII observation file are written with a precision of a
tenth of a millimeter for observations and one nanosecond for receiver clock
values. As a consequence the content of observation files may be slightly
different after a binary &gt; ASCII &gt; binary conversion. The program
GPSEST may, e.g., estimate slightly different receiver clock corrections.
Nevertheless the precision is high enough that no influence on the solution
itself is expected.

<p><b>GENERAL FILES</b>
<p><b>Show all general files:</b>
Check this box to get a list of the general input files used by this program
as well as the currently active campaign, session, and session table.

<br><br>

<a name="FCZFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Zero difference observations</b> <b>code:</b>
Select a list of ASCII code zero difference files to be converted into binary.
The resulting binary header and observation data files will have the same
filename as the input ASCII files but with different extensions.
Leave this field empty if you don't want to convert observation
files for this type.

<a name="FPZFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Zero difference observations</b> <b>phase:</b>
Select a list of ASCII phase zero difference files to be converted into binary.
The resulting binary header and observation data files will have the same
filename as the input ASCII files but with different extensions.
Leave this field empty if you don't want to convert observation
files for this type.

<a name="BOTHZERO" default=""></a>
<p><b>Zero difference observations</b> <b>both:</b>
Check this box if you have code and phase zero difference files with identical
names that you like to convert to binary in one run. The selection lists from
the ASCII code and phase zero difference files will be merged and the files
for both types of observations will be converted into binary.

<a name="FCSFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Single difference observations</b> <b>code:</b>
Select a list of ASCII code single difference files to be converted
into binary.
The resulting binary header and observation data files will have the same
filename as the input ASCII files but with different extensions.
Leave this field empty if you don't want to convert observation
files for this type.

<a name="FPSFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Single difference observations</b> <b>phase:</b>
Select a list of ASCII phase single difference files to be converted
into binary.
The resulting binary header and observation data files will have the same
filename as the input ASCII files but with different extensions.
Leave this field empty if you don't want to convert observation
files for this type.

<a name="BOTHSING" default=""></a>
<p><b>Single difference observations</b> <b>both:</b>
Check this box if you have code and phase single difference files with
identical names that you like to convert to binary in one run. The selection
lists from the ASCII code and phase single difference files will be merged
and the files for both types of observations will be converted into binary.

<a name="FRZFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Range observations:</b>
Select a list of ASCII range files to be converted into binary.
The resulting binary header and observation data files will have the same
filename as the input ASCII files but with different extensions.
Leave this field empty if you don't want to convert observation
files for this type.

<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<br><br>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output.
The title should characterize the program run.
