<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
The program GRDS1S2 extracts from a grid of atmospheric pressure tidal
loading corrections the coefficients for a list of stations given in a
Bernese formatted coordinate file.

<a name="S1_S2_DATA" default="s1_s2_def_ce.dat"></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>S1/S2 loading grid:</b>
The grid file containing S1/S2 atmospheric pressure loading tidal corrections
is specified here.
<br>
The file may contain comment lines at the beginning. They are indicated by
<tt>$$</tt> as the first two characters of the line. These comment lines
are repeated in the resulting "S1/S2 loading coeff." file.
<br>
Below follows the data part. It is expected that the file contains
the following columns:
<ul>
<li>Longitude of the grid point
<li>Latitude  of the grid point
<li>cosine term for S1, radial component
<li>sine   term for S1, radial component
<li>cosine term for S2, radial component
<li>sine   term for S2, radial component
<li>cosine term for S1, north component
<li>sine   term for S1, north component
<li>cosine term for S2, north component
<li>sine   term for S2, north component
<li>cosine term for S1, east component
<li>sine   term for S1, east component
<li>cosine term for S2, east component
<li>sine   term for S2, east component
</ul>
The files must be located in the directory <tt>$X/GEN</tt>. According to the
IERS Conventions 2010 the file <a href="/$X/GEN/s1_s2_def_ce.dat">
$X/GEN/s1_s2_def_ce.dat</a> shall be used. It is distributed together with
the software.

<p><i>Note:</i>
If you plan to correct for the non-tidal atmospheric loading during the data
processing (<a href="GPSEST.HLP#ALOAD_FILES">GPSEST: ATM-NT-LOAD</a>)
it is essential that you use the consistent set of tidal corrections there
(<a href="GPSEST.HLP#ATMLOAD">GPSEST: Atm. tidal loading corrections</a>).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>s1_s2_def_ce.dat</tt>

<a name="CMCYN" default="CoF"></a>
<p><b>Reference:</b>
Here the reference of the S1/S2 tidal atmospheric pressure is specified:
<ul>
<li><b>CoF</b>: Center of figure (or approx. Center of Earth)
<li><b>CoM</b>: Center of mass
</ul>
If you use <b>CoF</b>, then you have to apply center of mass corrections (CMC).
Such corrections are specified in a separate section of panel
"GRDS1S2 2: Options".
<br>The difference between Center of figure (CoF) and Center of Earth (CoE) are
minor in this context. If you only have a CoE related file available you may
use this instead of a CoF-based set.

<p><i>Note:</i> The differences between Center of figure (CoF) and Center of Earth (CoE) are
minor in this context. If you only have a CoE related file available you may
use this instead of a CoF-based set.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>CoF</tt>

<a name="COORD" default=""></a>
<p><b>Input coordinate file:</b>
Select the name of the input coordinate file. For all stations in this file
S1/S2 tidal atmospheric pressure loading coefficients are provided in the
result file.

<br><br>

<a name="S1_S2_OUT" default=""></a>
<p><b>RESULT FILE</b>
<p><b>S1/S2 loading coeff.:</b>
The result file contains the tidal atmospheric loading coefficients for
all stations given in the "Input coordinate file". It is used in the
processing programs to correct the observations for this effect.
<br>
According to your reference it may also contain the center of mass
corrections (CMC). In that case it becomes additionally relevant for some
of the orbit programs.

<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<p><b>GRDS1S2 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="DATUM" default="DATUM."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Geodetic datum:</b>
This file contains the definition of the geodetic datum and of the
ellipsoid to be used to compute ellipsoidal coordinates. It is used
to apply antenna heights and for the printing of coordinates in the
local system (north, east, up). You only have to modify this file
when you want to introduce a new reference ellipsoid.

<p><i>Caution:</i>
This file has no effect on Cartesian coordinates.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/DATUM.">$X/GEN/DATUM.</a>

<p><b>GRDS1S2 2: Options</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
to document the program run. The title should characterize the program run by,
e.g., giving the most important options used and the session.

<p><b>ADD S1/S2 CENTER OF MASS CORRECTIONS</b>
<p><b>Coefficients from:</b>
You may select a series of coefficients from where the center of mass
corrections (CMC) for S1/S2 tidal atmospheric pressure loading are
written into the resulting file. The IERS 2010 conventions recommend
to use the model from <b>RAY_PONTE</b>
(<a href="REFERENCES.HLP#Ray_Ponte_2003">Ray and Ponte, 2003</a>).
<br>
Alternatively you may include other sets of coefficients by selecting
<b>MANUAL</b> as the source of CMC. With this selection the input fields for
the individual corrections and a name of the model become active.

<p><i>Note</i>:
This section of input fields is inactive if the "Reference"
of the S1/S2 atmospheric pressure loading grid is <b>CoM</b> (Center of mass) because
in that case no CMC is necessary.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>RAY_PONTE</tt>
