<p><b>LIST OF CAMPAIGNS</b>
<p><b>Campaign directory:</b>
Maintain the list of campaign directories. Each line should consist of the
campaign drive (e.g., <tt>${P}/</tt>) and the name of the campaign (e.g.,
<tt>DOCU50</tt>).
For this example the full campaign directory reads <tt>${P}/DOCU50</tt>.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
Filenames are unfortunately limited to 32 characters
in the Bernese GNSS Software. The name of the campaign should, therefore,
not exceed 8 characters. It is in addition
recommended to use environment variables to specify the campaign drive,
instead of the complete path name. The environment
variables used have to be contained in the corresponding list in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Menu variables</b>. Curly brackets enclosing
the environment variables are mandatory.
