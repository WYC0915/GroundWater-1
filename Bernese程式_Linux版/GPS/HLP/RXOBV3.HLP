<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
This program converts the RINEX observation files into the Bernese
observation file format. Numerous checks for the content of
the RINEX header information are implemented. The entries for the Bernese
observation header files may be translated to standardized values if necessary.

Check this box to get a list of the general input files used by this program
as well as the currently active campaign, session, and session table.

<a name="SMTFILE" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Filename:</b>
Select the RINEX observation files to be converted to Bernese.
A list of files may be processed in one program run. For each
RINEX file a Bernese zero difference code and/or a zero difference phase
observation file may be created. You may cut the observations to a
time window specified in a separate panel below
("RXOBV3 3: Observation Window").
If you would like to concatenate or split RINEX files
use the program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#CCRINEXO">CCRINEXO</a> before
transferring the data into the Bernese observation file format.
<br>
Select the type of RINEX observation files you want to transfer
into Bernese observation file format and specify the filenames
in the corresponding input field:
<ul>
<li>You can transfer original RINEX observation files. The default
    extension is <tt>yyO</tt> where yy is the two digit year of the current
    session. Select the current session in the dialogue
    <a href="SETDATE.HLP">Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Set session/compute day</a>.
<li>If you have preprocessed your RINEX observation files using the program
    <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a> you have to import
    smoothed RINEX observation files (default extension <tt>SMT</tt>).
</ul>

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>????$S+0</tt>

<a name="STAINFO" default=""></a>
<p><b>Station information file:</b>
This file contains station specific information.
It is used to verify RINEX header information such as station names,
receiver and antenna names, antenna heights etc., and to adapt the station
information records to well defined names before writing to the Bernese
observation header files. For the consistency checks the <tt>TYPE 001:
RENAMING OF STATIONS</tt>, <tt>TYPE 002: STATION INFORMATION</tt>, and
<tt>TYPE 005: HANDLING STATION TYPES</tt> sections are used. In addition the
section <tt>TYPE 003: HANDLING OF STATION PROBLEMS</tt> is used to suppress
writing of Bernese observation files if a station is flagged as bad in
the appropriate time window.
<br>
If no file is specified the verification is skipped. The values from
the RINEX header are written as such into the Bernese observation files.
You should do this only if you are very sure that the entries in the RINEX
header are correct.
<br>
The same file may be used to adapt the station information record in the
program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#CHGHED">CHGHED</a> (for existing Bernese
observation files) and <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a> (for
existing Bernese normal equation files).

<a name="SAVPHS" default="1"></a>
<a name="RADIO_R" default="0"></a>
<p><b>RESULT FILES</b>
<p><b>Measurement types to save:</b>
Using this group of buttons you specify the types of Bernese observation
files which RXOBV3 will write. Either GPS/GLONASS observations (<b>Code</b>
and/or <b>Phase</b>) or <b>Range</b>s (SLR) can be saved.
<br>
In all cases the names of the Bernese observation files will be generated
automatically using the 4 character entries in the station name abbreviation
table (specified in the field "Abbreviation table" under "GENERAL INPUT FILES"
below) for the corresponding station and the 4 character session ID (see
option "SESSION IDENTIFIER" below).

<p><i>Default value:</i> Usually you will store code and phase data.

<a name="COORD" default=""></a>
<p><b>Update coordinates:</b>
If you enter a coordinate filename here the site coordinates in the header of
the RINEX observation files will be added for stations not contained
in this coordinate file. If you do not have any good a priori
coordinates at the beginning of the processing of a campaign you may use this
option to build up a coordinate file containing the RINEX coordinates
(coordinate flag <tt>R</tt>). You may specify the name of an existing or of a new
coordinate file.
<br>
If the field is left blank no coordinate file will be updated.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.CRD">Example</a>

<p><i>Default value:</i> blank

<br><br>

<a name="SYSODEF" default="1"></a>
<a name="SYSOUT"  default="RXOBV3"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<p><hr>

<p><b>RXOBV3 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="CONST" default="CONST."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>General constants:</b>
This file contains all the physical and astronomical constants used
in the Bernese GNSS Software. Most probably you will never have to
modify this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">$X/GEN/CONST.</a>

<a name="SATELL" default="SATELLIT.I08"></a>
<p><b>Satellite information:</b>
This file contains general information on GNSS (and LEO/GEO) satellites.
For the session to be processed,
each satellite has to appear once in this file
within a corresponding time window.

<p><i>Note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/SATELLIT. is maintained by AIUB/CODE.
It includes a complete history concerning the GPS satellite constellation
(and newly launched satellites are regularly added).
You can get the latest version of this file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If the information record for a satellite is missing in
this file for the measurement epoch the corresponding observations are
not transferred into the Bernese observation files. A warning message is
issued in that case.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08</a>

<a name="SATCRUX" default="SAT_$Y+0"></a>
<p><b>Satellite problems:</b>
This file contains information on satellite problems concerning modeling.
It is used for exclusion of misbehaving satellites
(and for orbit arc splitting).
It may also contain (mean) epochs of GPS repositioning events.

<p><i>Note:</i>
Corresponding year-specific files are maintained by AIUB/CODE.
You can get the latest version of the current file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/SAT_2003.CRX">$X/GEN/SAT_2003.CRX</a>

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>SAT_$Y+0</tt>

<a name="RECEIVR" default="RECEIVER."></a>
<p><b>Receiver information:</b>
This file contains in essence the code measurement types for a list of
receivers. These specifications are relevant when considering so-called
differential (<nobr>P1-P2</nobr> or <nobr>P1-C1</nobr>) code biases.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/RECEIVER.">$X/GEN/RECEIVER.</a>

<a name="PHASECC" default="PCV.I08"></a>
<p><b>Phase center offsets:</b>
This file contains receiver antenna phase center offsets and optionally
elevation-dependent phase center patterns.
In addition, the file may contain satellite-specific antenna
phase center patterns (dependent on nadir angle) as well as offset values.
Corresponding offset (correction) values, however, are not yet considered
by the software.
The satellite antenna offset values applied correspond to
those given in <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08</a>.
<br>
You have to modify this file when you use a new antenna type
or when you wish to consider your own PCV calibrations.
The program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ATX2PCV">ATX2PCV</a> allows to convert
PCV information given in ANTEX format into Bernese-formatted PCV tables.

<p><i>Important note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.REL contains PCV values
for most of the receiver antenna types commonly used
within IGS (and EUREF).
These PCV values are addressed as 'relative' values
as they are generally referred to
a specific receiver antenna type (AOAD/M_T).
For this reference antenna type
(as well as implicitly all GNSS antenna types),
PCV patterns are assumed to be nonexistent.
Sooner or later, it will become common to consider 'absolutely' calibrated
receiver and satellite antenna PCV values.
A corresponding file ($X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.ABS) will be made available
as soon as this is the case.
<br>
RXOBV3 uses this file only to check that the antenna names written
to the Bernese observation file headers exist in this file. See
option "Check phase center file for antenna type" in the section
"ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION" below for more details.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The availability of the records for the satellites in the
"Phase center offsets" file is not checked.

<p>Example:<a href="/$X/GEN/PCV.I08">$X/GEN/PCV.I08</a>.

<a name="GPSUTC" default="GPSUTC."></a>
<p><b>GPS-UTC seconds:</b>
Select the file with GPS-UTC values here. You have to update this file each
time a leap second is introduced.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/GPSUTC.">$X/GEN/GPSUTC.</a>

<a name="ABBREV" default="ABBREV">
<p><b>Abbreviation table:</b></a>
This file contains a station name abbreviation table containing
<nobr>4-character</nobr>
and <nobr>2-character</nobr> abbreviations for a list of station names.
The <nobr>4-character</nobr> station name abbreviations are used to generate
the zero-difference observation filenames in RXOBV3.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The names of the observation files in Bernese format are
generated automatically. Therefore, please take care, that all stations
you want to process have different <nobr>4-character</nobr> abbreviations.
Otherwise the observation files may be overwritten.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ABB">Example</a>

<a name="FRQINFO" default="">
<p><b>Frequency information:</b></a>
This file contains the frequency information (frequency value, measurement
type, frequency number) for all observation types. Entries are specified by the
measurement type, the satellite or station name, and the duration of validity.
Currently, it is used for range measurements (SLR) only.
The frequency value is needed for the MARINI-MURRAY troposphere model,
used for SLR data analysis.

<a name="AUXPHS" default="RXOBV3$J"></a><p>
<p><b>TEMPORARY FILES</b>
<p>
Enter the names of the scratch files used by this program. The scratch files
need to be named differently for different programs running
simultaneously. This may be achieved, e.g., by adding the job ID
<tt>$J</tt> to the program name (define the job ID in the dialogue
<a href="SETDATE.HLP">Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Set session/compute day</a>).

<p><i>Default values:</i> <tt>RXOBV3$J</tt>

<p><hr>

<p><b>RXOBV3 2: Input Options 1</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be included into the Bernese observation file
headers. The title should characterize the program run by, e.g., giving
the most important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="SATSYS" default="ALL"></a>
<p><b>SATELLITE SYSTEM SELECTION</b>
<p><b>Satellite system to be considered:</b>
Observation data from one specific (<b>GPS</b>, <b>GLONASS</b>, <b>GALILEO</b>),
several (<b>GPS/GAL</b>, <b>GPS/GLO</b>, <b>GLO/GAL</b>) or <b>ALL</b> satellite
systems may be selected here.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>ALL</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="STANAM" default="FILE_NAME"></a>
<p><b>STATION NAMES</b>
<p><b>Gather station names from:</b>
The station names can be gathered from different sources. These station names
either will be stored as such in the Bernese observation files or - if a
"Station information file" was specified in the "INPUT FILES" section - will
be used as basis for the renaming/consistency check procedure.

<p>You have four choices:
<ul>
<li><b>MARKER_NAME:</b> The <tt>MARKER&nbsp;NAME</tt> entry of the RINEX
    observation file is used as station name.
<li><b>MARKER_NUMBER:</b> The <tt>MARKER&nbsp;NUMBER</tt> entry of the RINEX
    observation file is used as station name.
<li><b>MARKER_DOMES:</b> The <tt>MARKER&nbsp;NAME</tt> and the
    <tt>MARKER&nbsp;NUMBER</tt> entry of the RINEX observation file is
    combined to get a station name
    according to IGS conventions: The first four characters of the
    <tt>MARKER&nbsp;NAME</tt> and the first nine characters of the
    <tt>MARKER NUMBER</tt>
    (assuming a Domes number) are concatenate to get names of the form
    <tt>ZIMM&nbsp;14001M004</tt>.
<li><b>FILE_NAME:</b> The first four characters of the RINEX observation
    filename will be used as station name.
</ul>
The best choice for you depends on the convention adopted for your campaign.
For the transfer of RINEX observation files from IGS we propose to use
"FILE_NAME" if you have specified a "Station information file" in the "INPUT
FILES" section.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>FILE_NAME</tt> for processing RINEX observation
files from IGS.

<a name="ABBUPD" default="UPDATE"></a>
<p><b>Action if station not in abbreviation list:</b>
To generate the filenames the program uses the <nobr>4-character</nobr> station
abbreviations given in the abbreviation table (field "Abbreviation table"
under "GENERAL INPUT FILES"). You have three choices to handle the case that a
station is missing in this file:
<ul>
<li><b>ERROR</b>: The program will stop with an error if the station name could
    not be found in the station abbreviation table.
<li><b>UPDATE</b>: The program will automatically create new
    <nobr>4-character</nobr> and <nobr>2-character</nobr> abbreviations from the
    station name if it could not be found in the abbreviation table.
    Only upper case letters and digits are used to generate new and unique
    abbreviations.
<li><b>UPDATE+</b>: The program will automatically create new
    <nobr>4-character</nobr> and <nobr>2-character</nobr> abbreviations from the
    station name if it could not be found in the abbreviation table.
    Upper case and lower case characters and digits are used to generate new and
    unique abbreviations.
    <br>
    <i>Remark for WINDOWS:</i>
    The option is only reasonable
    if the operating system allows for case sensitive filenames. This
    is <b>not</b> the case for WINDOWS platforms.
</ul>

<p><i>Remark:</i>
Be careful when selecting either UPDATE or UPDATE+: The program
will automatically update the abbreviation table on your hard disk after
creating a new abbreviation set. If more than one program RXOBV3 is running
in the same campaign at the same time interactions may be possible!

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>UPDATE</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="SESSID" default="$S+0"></a>
<p><b>SESSION IDENTIFIER</b>
<p><b>Session ID used for Bernese observation files:</b>
Select the session ID (4 characters) which should be used for the naming of
the Bernese observation files as well as written into the Bernese observation
header files. This session ID must be defined in the
<a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session table</a>. It is used later by the programs
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#SNGDIF">SNGDIF</a> and
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a> to identify observation files with
simultaneous observations for building baselines and for setting up the
correlations between stations/baselines respectively.
<br>
If you leave the field blank the session the Bernese observation files
belong to will be determined automatically. If you have a
RINEX observation file which covers - after being cut to the observation window
specified in panel "RXOBV3 3: Observation Window" - more than one session it is
recommended to specify the session explicitly for the naming of the Bernese
observation files.

<p><i>Default value:</i>  <tt>$S+0</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="SAMPL" default="30"></a>
<p><b>DATA SAMPLING</b>
<p><b>Sampling interval:</b>
Select the sampling rate in seconds of the observations in the Bernese
observation files. The default sampling rate within the IGS is 30&nbsp;seconds but 
there may be stations which have a higher sampling rate (e.g., 10&nbsp;seconds). 
<br>
Leave the input field empty or set the value to <tt>0</tt> if all
observations from the RINEX file should be transferred to the Bernese
observation files.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>30</tt>&nbsp;seconds

<a name="SOFFSET" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Sampling offset to full minute:</b>
Select the sampling offset to the full minute in seconds. The sampling rate
selected in the previous option "Sampling interval" is counted starting with
the offset you select here. E.g., if you sample your original 10&nbsp;sec data
at 60&nbsp;seconds, you might specify an offset of 10&nbsp;seconds to the full
minute. The observation epochs of the resulting Bernese observation file will
then be 10&nbsp;sec, 70&nbsp;sec, 130&nbsp;sec, ... .

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0</tt>

<p><hr>

<p><b>RXOBV3 3: Observation Window</b>

<a name="RADIO_0" default="0"></a>
<p><b>OBSERVATION WINDOW</b>
<p>
This panel allows to define a time window. If you specify a window only
observations falling into this time window will be processed.
<br>
You may choose one of the following options:

<p><b>Take all observations:</b> Select this option to convert all observations
available in the RINEX files into Bernese format.

<a name="RADIO_1" default="1"></a>
<a name="SESSION_YEAR" default="$Y+0"></a>
<a name="SESSION_STRG" default="$S+0"></a>
<p><b>Year and Session identifier:</b>
You may specify one session from the <a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session table</a>.
The boundaries of this session define the observation window. If you use an
open session table the year has to be specified in addition to the session
identifier. If you use a fixed session table the year is read from the session
definition and the value in the panel is ignored.
<br>
It is possible to specify a range of sessions using the corresponding
menu variable (<tt>$S+-</tt>). In this case the time window starts at the
beginning of the first session of the range and stops at the end of the last
session of the range. If you use an open session table the year should also
be given with the range variable (<tt>$Y+-</tt>).

<p><i>Default values:</i> Year: <tt>$Y+0</tt> session: <tt>$S+0</tt>

<a name="RADIO_2" default="0"></a>
<a name="STADAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="STATIM" default="00 00 00"></a>
<a name="ENDDAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="ENDTIM" default="23 59 59"></a>
<p><b>Start and End times:</b>
Specify date and time for the begin and the end of the observation window.
<br>
To specify a time window which is open on one side of the interval,
leave the corresponding input field for the start/end date empty. The
associated start/end time is then ignored.

<p><i>Default values for daily processing:</i> Start date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
start time: <tt>00&nbsp;00&nbsp;00</tt>, end date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
end time: <tt>23&nbsp;59&nbsp;59</tt>

<p><hr>

<p><b>RXOBV3 4: Input Options 2 </b>

<a name="MINSIG" default="1"></a>
<p><b>SIGNAL STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS</b>
<p><b>Minimum signal strength:</b>
This option can be used to eliminate data with a low signal/noise
ratio. According to the RINEX format definition the signal/noise
ratio is mapped into values from 0 to 9. By setting this option, e.g.,
to 1, you can remove any data with signal/noise values of 0.
Some RINEX converters use a value of 0 to mark bad observations.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
When converting observations cleaned by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a> set the minimum signal strength to
2 to eliminate bad observations.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1</tt> for original RINEX files or <tt>2</tt>
for smoothed RINEX files

<a name="ACCEPT0" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Accept signal strength = 0:</b>
In addition to the previous option you may specify whether data with a
signal strength of 0 should be kept. Some RINEX converters do not provide
the signal strength.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked for original RINEX files or unmarked
for smoothed RINEX files

<a name="ACCEPTCS" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Accept cycle slip flags from RINEX:</b>
This option is available for processing zero difference phase
observations. If the RINEX files are cleaned, e.g., by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a>, then the cycle slips may
safely be accepted. In this case an ambiguity parameter will be
set up in the phase zero-difference header file for each flag.
The cycle slip flags from original RINEX files should <b>not</b>
be accepted. There may be large numbers of flags in the RINEX
files which may cause problems with array dimensions.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked for original RINEX files or marked
for smoothed RINEX files

<br><br>

<a name="REQEPO" default="10"></a>
<p><b>MINIMUM OBSERVATION NUMBER</b>
<p><b>Minimum number of epochs requested per file:</b>
To exclude stations with a small number of epochs (considering the sampling
specified above) you may specify a minimum number of epochs. If the
Bernese observation file would contain less epochs than specified the data
are not imported into Bernese format. An empty input field means that all
observation files are accepted.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>10&nbsp;epochs</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="RADOME" default="1"></a>
<p><b>OPTIONS CONCERNING ANTENNAS</b>
<p><b>Consider radome code of the antennas:</b>
According to the IGS standards the radome code is given in the RINEX
observation files in
characters 17 to 20 of the antenna name. You can specify whether you want to
use the radome code or not. If the box is unmarked the characters 17 to 20 of
the antenna name from RINEX are set to blank.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
Be sure to use this option and the entries in the "Station
information file" as well as in the "Phase center offsets" file in a
consistent way.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<a name="CORRAD" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Correct position of radome code:</b>
You may activate this option to handle incorrectly positioned radome codes in
IGS RINEX data. Note that this option is independent of the above setting.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="DOANTVER" default="1"></a>
<a name="ANTVER" default="WARNING"></a>
<p><b>Check phase center file for antenna type:</b>
This option allows you to verify the content of the "Phase center offsets"
file specified in "GENERAL INPUT FILES" above. The program checks whether the
antenna type specified in the RINEX file and translated according to
the "Station information file" is contained in that file. You may select one
of the following actions to handle the case that the antenna type
is not found:
<ul>
<li><b>WARNING:</b> The program issues a warning message and continues
        execution.</li>
<li><b>SKIP:</b> The program issues a warning message and continues execution.
        The RINEX file causing the message is <b>not</b> converted into Bernese
        format.</li>
<li><b>ERROR:</b> The program issues an error message and stops execution.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The availability of the records for the satellites in the
"Phase center offsets" file is not checked.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>WARNING</tt> for manual processing,
<tt>SKIP</tt> for a robust automated processing

<br><br>

<a name="EPOFLAG" default="SKIP"></a>
<p><b>EVENT FLAG HANDLING</b>
<p><b>What to do in case of event flags:</b>
RINEX observation files may contain event flags. A flag 4 means that an
additional RINEX header (or a part of a RINEX header) follows. All other
flags (e.g., start moving antenna, or new site occupation) are not handled
by RXOBV3. If such an event flag is found in the input RINEX file the selection
for this option specifies:
<ul>
<li><b>WARNING:</b> to ignore the record of the epoch flag and to continue
        importing the observations from the RINEX file.</li>
<li><b>SKIP:</b> to skip the RINEX file (no Bernese observation files are
        written) and to continue importing the observations from the next
        RINEX input file in the list.</li>
<li><b>ERROR:</b> to stop the program with an error.</li>
</ul>
The program issues a warning resp. an error message in any case.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>SKIP</tt>

<p><b>RXOBV3 5.1: Check Content of RINEX Header 1</b>

<a name="TSTANAM" default="WARNING"></a>
<a name="TRYFILE" default="1"></a>
<p><b>ACTIONS IN CASE OF INCONSISTENCIES</b>
<p>
The program may compare the header information in the RINEX observation
files and the entries in the "Station information file" specified in the
"INPUT FILES" section. You may select one of the following actions to handle
the case that these entries are not consistent. This is in particular helpful
for automated processing:
<ul>
<li><b>NO_CHECK:</b> Any entry in the actual RINEX file will be accepted
        without error or warning. When selecting this option you have to be
        sure that the information in the RINEX header is correct.</li>
<li><b>WARNING:</b> Any entry in the actual RINEX file will be accepted. If
        the entry differs from the expected value a warning message is
        issued. Check the warning messages in the "Error messages" file
        carefully in order to identify problems.
<li><b>SKIP:</b> If the entry in the actual RINEX file differs from the
        expected value a warning message is issued and the corresponding RINEX
        file is NOT converted into Bernese format. This is a very safe setting
        to eliminate stations with potential problems (e.g., antenna change) in
        an automatic processing environment. </li>
<li><b>ERROR:</b> If the entry in the actual RINEX file differs from the
        expected value an error message is issued and the program stops.</li>
</ul>
These four options may be selected independently for "Station name",
"Receiver/antenna type", "Receiver/antenna number", "Antenna position", and "Marker
type", see below. The program provides in its output an extended summary on
station renaming and station information. Each line of the summary tables
contain a string <tt>#OK</tt> if no problem was identified, a string
<tt>#Problem</tt> if a problem was found, or <tt>#Verify</tt> if a
verification of an information failed (see field "ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION"
below).
The hash strings may be used for easy extraction of information from the
program output file.

<p><b>Station name:</b>
The station name (see your setting in option "Gather station names from")
is compared with the old station name in the
<tt>TYPE 001: RENAMING OF STATIONS</tt> section of the "Station information
file".
Wildcards are allowed here.
If there is no match within the appropriate time window this option specifies
the action of the program (see description above).
<br>
Even if this option is set to <b>NO_CHECK</b> the renaming of stations from the
<tt>TYPE 001: RENAMING OF STATIONS</tt> section of the "Station information
file" are performed.
All following checks refer to the new name of the station which will be
written also to the Bernese observation files.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>WARNING</tt> for manual processing,
<tt>SKIP</tt> for a robust automated processing

<p><b>Try also filename:</b>
If this option is activated and the station name consistency check failed
the 4 character ID from the RINEX observation file is used as station name
and the procedure described above is repeated. Only if also this second
check fails the action specified for the inconsistency of the "Station name"
is executed.
<br>
This option makes no sense if the option "Gather station names from" is
already set to <b>FILE_NAME</b>.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<a name="TANTTYP" default="WARNING"></a>
<p><b>Receiver/antenna type:</b>
The entries for the <tt>REC TYPE</tt> and <tt>ANT TYPE</tt> in the actual
RINEX observation file are compared with the <tt>RECEIVER TYPE</tt> and
<tt>ANTENNA TYPE</tt> in the
<tt>TYPE 002: STATION INFORMATION</tt> section of the "Station information file"
(wildcards allowed).
The (new) station name and the time window are used to identify the correct
entry.
The option specifies the action of the program in case no entry is found
(description above).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>WARNING</tt> for manual processing,
<tt>SKIP</tt> for a robust automated processing

<a name="TANTNUM" default="WARNING"></a>
<p><b>Receiver/antenna number:</b>
The entry for the <tt>REC #</tt> and <tt>ANT #</tt> in the actual RINEX
observation file is compared with the corresponding values in the
<tt>TYPE 002: STATION INFORMATION</tt> section of the "Station information
file".
The (new) station name and the time window are used to identify the correct
entry.
The option specifies the action of the program in case no entry is found
(description above).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>WARNING</tt>

<a name="TANTPOS" default="WARNING"></a>
<p><b>Antenna position:</b>
The entry for the <tt>ANTENNA: DELTA H/E/N</tt> in the actual RINEX
observation file is compared with the <tt>NORTH</tt>, <tt>EAST</tt> and
<tt>UP</tt> in the
<tt>TYPE 002: STATION INFORMATION</tt> section of the "Station information
file".
The (new) station name and the time window are used to identify the correct
entry.
The option specifies the action of the program in case no entry is found
(description above).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>WARNING</tt> for manual processing,
<tt>SKIP</tt> for a robust automated processing

<a name="TMRKTYP" default="WARNING"></a>
<p><b>Marker type:</b>
The entry for the <tt>MARKER TYPE</tt> (if present) in the actual RINEX
observation file is compared with the marker type in the
<tt>TYPE 005: HANDLING STATION TYPES</tt> section of the "Station
information file".
If the marker type is <tt>SPACEBORNE</tt> the availability of a corresponding
entry for the station/LEO in the "Satellite information" file is checked.
The option specifies the action of the program in case no entry is found
(description above).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>WARNING</tt>

<a name="DOSTAVER" default="1"></a>
<a name="STAVER" default="MARKER_DOMES"></a>
<p><b>ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION</b>
<p>
The following options may be used to perform additional verifications on
station names and equipment in order to monitor the consistency of the
information contained in the RINEX file headers. If a verification fails the
corresponding line in the information summary provided in the program output
will contain a string <tt>#Verify</tt>. The failure of a verification step has
no effect on the execution of the program.

<p><b>Verify station name/number using:</b>
Enable this option if you want to verify the (new) station name with respect
to the station name given in the header of the RINEX observation file. The
station name may be
compared to the
<ul>
<li><b>MARKER_NAME</b>:
    The <tt>MARKER NAME</tt> entry of the RINEX observation file.
<li><b>MARKER_NUMBER</b>:
    The <tt>MARKER NUMBER</tt> entry of the RINEX observation file.
<li><b>MARKER_DOMES</b>:
    The <tt>MARKER NAME</tt> and the <tt>MARKER NUMBER</tt> entry of the RINEX
    observation file is combined to get a station name according to IGS
    conventions:
    The first four characters of the <tt>MARKER NAME</tt> and the first nine
    characters of the <tt>MARKER NUMBER</tt> (assuming a Domes number) are
    concatenated to get names of the form <tt>ZIMM&nbsp;14001M004</tt>.
</ul>
The correct choice for you depends on the convention you adopted for your
campaign.
For the transfer of RINEX observation files from IGS we propose to verify with
respect to the "MARKER_DOMES" entry.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>MARKER_DOMES</tt> for processing RINEX observation files from IGS

<a name="RNXVER" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Verify station name using RINEX filename:</b>
Enable this option to verify the first four characters of the (new) station
name with respect to the first four characters of the RINEX filename.
<br>
This convention applies for RINEX observation files from the IGS. It may
not be true for your own campaign.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked for processing RINEX observation files from IGS

<a name="DOFRQVER" default="1"</a>
<a name="FRQVER" default="WARNING"</a>
<p><b>Check frequency information file for frequency:</b>
The program may compare the header information in the RINEX observation
files and the entries in the "Frequency information" file specified in the
"GENERAL INPUT FILES" section. You may select one of the following actions to
handle the case that the frequency entries are not consistent. This is in
particular helpful for automated processing:
<ul>
<li><b>WARNING:</b> Any entry in the actual RINEX file will be accepted. If
        the frequency information entry differs from the expected value a
        warning message is issued. Check the warning messages in the
        "Error messages" file carefully in order to identify problems.
<li><b>SKIP:</b> If the entry in the actual RINEX file differs from the
        expected frequency value a warning message is issued and the corresponding RINEX
        file is NOT converted into Bernese format. This is a very safe setting
        to eliminate stations with potential problems in
        an automatic processing environment. </li>
<li><b>ERROR:</b> If the frequency information in the actual RINEX file differs from the
        expected value an error message is issued and the program stops.</li>
<li><b>UPDATE:</b> If there is no frequency entry for a station and the corresponding 
        observation time the frequency information file will be updated. The new record 
        will contain the station name, the frequency information and
        the first observation epoch found in the RINEX file.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>WARNING</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="RNXINFO" default=""></a>
<p><b>HANDLING OF KNOWN INCONSISTENCIES</b>
<p><b>Accepted station information:</b>
If for a particular station a certain inconsistency regularly appears
(e.g., misspelled receiver name or wrong antenna height in RINEX file)
you may suppress the corresponding warning or error message by adding a
line to a file containing the inconsistent values. If you specify the name
of this station problem file in this field, the program compares RINEX
entries not only with the content of the "Station information file" but
also with the entries in this file.
<br>
The entries in this station problem file resemble the
<tt>TYPE 002: STATION INFORMATION</tt> section of the station information
file except that the flag and the station description columns are missing.
Use <nobr><tt> *** UNDEFINED ***  </tt></nobr> (as indicated in the example
file) to represent undefined values, i.e., values which should not be checked.
