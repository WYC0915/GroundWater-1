<b>CREATE/UPDATE STATION SELECTION LIST</b>
<p>Editor: EDITFIX
</center>
<hr width="100%">

<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION </b>
<p>
The station selection file contains a list of station names.
The file can be used in a number of different contexts and the interpretation
of the list of stations is defined by the program into which it is introduced.
This input panel helps you to create or to edit this type of files.
<br>
To create a new station selection file specify a new filename in the file
selection dialogue. In this case you will be asked to select an existing
coordinate file. The station names will be read from this
file to generate a station selection file template.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The end of the station selection file is indicated by a blank line. Lines
below the blank line are ignored. If you use this input mask to edit a
station selection file these additional lines will be lost. If you want to
keep them in the file you have to use an external text file editor.
