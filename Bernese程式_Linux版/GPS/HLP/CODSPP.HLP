<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
The main purpose of the program CODSPP is the synchronization of receiver
clocks with GPS time and the determination of approximate station
coordinates using code zero-difference measurements. In addition the program
can be used to mark code outliers in the observation files.

<p><b>GENERAL FILES</b>
<p><b>Show all general files:</b>
Check this box to get a list of the general input files used by this program
as well as the currently active campaign, session, and session table.

<br><br>

<a name="RADIO_B" default="0"></a>
<a name="RADIO_S" default="1"></a>
<p><b>INPUT ORBITS</b>
<p>
For the point positioning using code observations either a broadcast
orbit or a standard orbit can be used (selected by the radio buttons). The
satellite clocks will either be taken from the broadcast orbit or from a
satellite clock file in Bernese format, if a standard orbit is used. Note
that only the input fields corresponding to the radio button settings are
active.

<a name="BRDEPH" default=""></a>
<p><b>Broadcast orbits:</b>
Select a broadcast orbit file (Bernese format). Only one file
may be selected. Therefore, only code observations covered by the
broadcast message in this file may be processed.
<br>
If a broadcast file is specified, the satellite clock
information is taken from the broadcast file.

<a name="STDORB" default=""></a>
<p><b>Standard orbits:</b>
Select a GNSS standard orbit file. Only one file may be selected. Therefore,
only code observations covered by the standard orbit may be processed.
If you use a standard orbit file, you will also have to specify a
satellite clock file.

<a name="SATCLK" default=""></a>
<p><b>Satellite clocks:</b>
Select the satellite clock file generated during the creation of
the standard orbit file chosen above.
<br>
Usually this file should contain a polynomial model of the satellite
clocks to make sure that values are available for all epochs.
Observations to satellites without a clock value are ignored. If there are
no clock values for all observed satellites at a certain epoch, this epoch will be
excluded from the further processing!

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE1.CLK">Example</a>

<br><br>

<a name="CODEFILE" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Code observation files:</b>
Selection of zero-difference code files to be processed. Several files
may be processed in the same program run.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>????$S+0</tt>

<a name="TROPEST" default=""></a>
<p><b>Estimated tropo.values:</b>
Here a troposphere estimates file from <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>
or <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a> can be
selected. This is only reasonable when using accurate clock information.
To activate the troposphere values set the atmosphere model in option
"Troposphere" in the section "ATMOSPHERE MODELS" to ESTIMATED.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.TRP">Example</a>

<p><i>Default value:</i> blank

<a name="VMF1_FILES" default=""></a>
<p><b>Maps of VMF1 coeff.:</b>
For the continued fraction of the troposphere mapping function, the
Vienna Mapping Functions 1 (VMF1, <a href="REFERENCES.HLP#Boehm_etal_2006">
B&ouml;hm et al., 2006</a>) rely on global grids of the a, b, and c coefficients,
partly based on the ray-tracing of the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) numerical weather models output. For more details
on the VMF1 or to download VMF1 grids, please visit the
<a href="LINKS.HLP#VMF1">VMF1 website</a>.

<a name="POLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>Pole file:</b>
This file contains the Earth rotation parameters (ERPs). It is used for
the transformations between the International Celestial Reference Frame
(ICRF) and the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). This
file has to be identical to the one used for the computation of the standard
orbit.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ERP">Example</a>

<a name="STAWGT" default=""></a>
<p><b>Station sigma factors:</b>
You may specify a file containing station observation sigma factors which
will be used for rescaling the outlier detection threshold individually for
each station (see options in "OUTLIER DETECTION" below).
This becomes important if you use the program CODSPP to screen the code
observations because the noise level of the pseudo-range measurements from
different receiver types may be significantly different. If you are using
smoothed code from program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a> rescaling
of the outlier threshold is not required.
<br>
Because the outlier rejection threshold for some of the stations is
rescaled by the sigma factors the same scaling factors have to be used for
all further processing of these observation files (e.g., parameter estimation
in <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>).

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.SOS">Example</a>

<p><i>Default value:</i> blank

<a name="COORD" default=""></a>
<p><b>A priori coordinates:</b>
Selection of an a priori coordinate file. This coordinate file must
contain all the sites you are processing.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.CRD">Example</a>

<a name="ECCENT" default=""></a>
<p><b>Site eccentricities:</b>
Optionally, a site coordinate eccentricity file, containing local ties
between markers, may be specified.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ECC">Example</a>

<a name="KININP" default=""></a>
<p><b>Kin. input coordinates:</b>
Optionally, you may introduce kinematic coordinates.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.KIN">Example</a>

<a name="DCBINP" default=""></a>
<p><b>Code bias input files:</b>
Selection of a code bias input file containing differential
(P1-P2 or P1-C1) code biases of satellites (and receivers) is
generally recommended. These biases are irrelevant only when
processing the L3 linear combination of code measurements from
P1/P2 (not C1/X2 or C1/P2) receivers.

<a name="SATELL" default="SATELLIT.I08"></a>
<p><b>Satellite information:</b>
This file contains general information on GNSS (and LEO/GEO) satellites.
For the session to be processed,
each satellite has to appear once in this file
within a corresponding time window.

<p><i>Note:</i>
The file <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08</a> is maintained
by AIUB/CODE.
It includes a complete history concerning the GPS satellite constellation
(and newly launched satellites are regularly added).
You can get the latest version of this file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<a name="RECEIVR" default="RECEIVER."></a>
<p><b>Receiver information:</b>
This file contains in essence the code measurement types for a list of
receivers. These specifications are relevant when considering so-called
differential (P1-P2 or P1-C1) code biases.

<a name="SATCRUX" default="SAT_$Y+0"></a>
<p><b>Satellite problems:</b>
This file contains information on satellite problems concerning modeling.
It is used for exclusion of misbehaving satellites
(and for orbit arc splitting).
It may also contain (mean) epochs of GPS repositioning events.

<p><i>Note:</i>
Corresponding year-specific files are maintained by AIUB/CODE.

<a name="STAINFO" default=""></a>
<p><b>Station information:</b>
This file contains station specific information. The program only considers
the marker types (TYPE 005) contained in this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.STA">Example</a>

<a name="DATUM" default="DATUM."></a>
<p><b>Geodetic datum:</b>
This file contains the definition of the geodetic datum and of the
ellipsoid to be used to compute ellipsoidal coordinates. It is used
to apply antenna heights and for the printing of coordinates in the
local system (north, east, up). You only have to modify this file
when you want to introduce a new reference ellipsoid.

<p><i>Caution:</i>
This file has no effect on Cartesian coordinates.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/DATUM.">$X/GEN/DATUM.</a>

<a name="PHASECC" default="PCV.I08"></a>
<p><b>Phase center eccentricities:</b>
This file contains receiver antenna phase center offsets and optionally
elevation-dependent phase center patterns.
In addition, the file may contain satellite-specific antenna
phase center patterns (dependent on nadir angle) as well as offset values.
Corresponding offset (correction) values, however, are not yet considered
by the software.
The satellite antenna offset values applied correspond to
those given in <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08</a>.
<br>
You have to modify this file when you use a new antenna type
or when you wish to consider your own PCV calibrations.
The program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ATX2PCV">ATX2PCV</a> allows to convert
PCV information given in ANTEX format into Bernese-formatted PCV tables.

<p><i>Important note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.REL contains PCV values
for most of the receiver antenna types commonly used
within IGS (and EUREF).
These PCV values are addressed as 'relative' values
as they are generally referred to
a specific receiver antenna type (AOAD/M_T).
For this reference antenna type
(as well as implicitly all GNSS antenna types),
PCV patterns are assumed to be nonexistent.
Sooner or later, it will become common to consider 'absolutely' calibrated
receiver and satellite antenna PCV values.
A corresponding file ($X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.ABS) will be made available
as soon as this is the case.

<a name="FRQINFO" default="">
<p><b>Frequency information:</b></a>
This file contains the frequency information (frequency value, measurement
type, frequency number) for all observation types. Entries are specified by the
measurement type, the satellite or station name, and the duration of validity.
Currently, it is used for range measurements (SLR) only.
The frequency value is needed for the MARINI-MURRAY troposphere model,
used for SLR data analysis.

<p><b>Satellite clock results:</b>
Save satellite clock file with all GLONASS satellite clock offsets
corrected for the difference in GLONASS and GPS system time estimated
in the program run. Satellite clocks are saved only if both GLONASS
and GPS satellites are present and if an input satellite clock file has
been specified (see option "Satellite clocks" in "INPUT ORBITS" section).

<p><b>Clock RINEX results:</b>
The estimates for the receiver clocks can be stored in the clock RINEX
format. Because this program performs a single point positioning all
satellite clocks are written as reference into this file.
If  dual GPS/GLONASS receivers are used to estimate the difference
between GPS and GLONASS time scales,  only the GPS satellites are given as

<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<p><b>CODSPP 2: Input Options</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
to document the program run. The title should characterize the program run by,
e.g., giving the most important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="FREQ" default="L3"></a>
<b>PARAMETERS</b>
<p><b>Frequency:</b>
The code observations of the L1 or L2 frequency or the ionosphere-free
linear combination (L3) may be processed. When L3 is selected, the
program will automatically switch to L1, if no or only few L2 observations
are available. Whenever possible L3 should be used to eliminate
the ionospheric refraction.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>L3</tt>

<a name="CLKPOLY" default="E"></a>
<p><b>Clock polynomial degree:</b>
With this option you specify the polynomial degree of the receiver
clock corrections you are estimating. The entire time interval of a
code observation file will be represented by a polynomial of the
specified degree. The maximum degree is 7. If you enter the option
<b>E</b>, a receiver clock offset will be determined for each observation
epoch. Some receivers produce millisecond jumps and may therefore only be
processed using the option <b>E</b>. You should use polynomials only, if
the receiver was driven by an excellent external oscillator (e.g., a
hydrogen maser).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>E</tt>

<a name="CLKSAVE" default="BOTH"></a>
<p><b>Save clock estimates:</b>
In normal operation the most important results of this program are
the receiver clock corrections with respect to GPS time. These
receiver clock corrections have to be saved in the code and phase
zero-difference observation files for later use!
<br>
For some special applications you can specify here the zero-difference
file type (code and/or phase) into which the clock corrections
shall be written.
With <b>NO</b> the receiver clock corrections will NOT be saved in any
of the zero-difference observation files.
<br>
In the case of a phase observation file it is assumed, that the code
and phase zero-difference observation files have corresponding
names.
<br>
Usually <b>BOTH</b> has to be entered to save the results in both code and phase
observation files. This is in most cases indispensable if you want to
continue the processing of the observation files. If code and phase will be
processed together the clock corrections in both observation files need to
be equal. Be careful if you insert another value for this option!

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>BOTH</tt>

<a name="COORDEST" default="NO"></a>
<p><b>Estimate coordinates:</b>
Specify whether static or kinematic coordinates shall be estimated or
whether coordinates shall not be estimated at all:
<ul>
<li><b>NO:</b>
    Do not estimate coordinates. If the results have very large residuals and
    you know to have good a priori coordinates available, it might help to fix
    the coordinates to their a priori values (leave checkbox unmarked) in order
    to identify the problem (e.g., a bad satellite). The a priori coordinates
    will be used as true values for the receiver clock estimation.
<li><b>STATIC:</b>
    Estimate one set of coordinates for all stations.
<li><b>KINEMATIC:</b>
    Select this option, if you wish to estimate kinematic coordinates
    (epoch-wise). This option is only allowed if the option
    "Clock polynomial degree" is set to E (clock
    offsets for each epoch). In case of mixed GPS/GLONASS files only GPS
    observations are considered for the estimation of kinematic
    coordinates.
</ul>

<a name="TROPOS" default="GMF"></a>
<p><b>ATMOSPHERE MODELS</b>
<p><b>Troposphere:</b>
There are several possibilities to model the tropospheric delay.
<ul>
<li><b>NONE:</b>
    No tropospheric correction is applied. This option should only be

<p><b>Ionosphere:</b>
If this checkbox is marked, a very simple ionosphere model will be
applied. This model has hardwired values for the day- and night-time

<a name="SAMPLE" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Sampling rate: </b>
Under special circumstances you may wish to only process every n-th
code observation epoch, which you can specify by this option.
If you use the epoch-wise receiver clock estimation (option <b>E</b> described

<p><b>Interpolation of clocks: </b>
The interpolation of the satellite clocks may be applicable if you process data
with a higher sampling than the available satellite clocks, e.g. LEO data with

<p><b>CODSPP 3.1: Observation Window</b>

<a name="RADIO_1" default="1"></a>
<a name="RADIO_2" default="0"></a>
<p><b>OBSERVATION WINDOW</b>
<p>
This panel allows to specify a time window. Only observations
within this time window will be used for processing.
<br>
You may define the time window either by using session definitions, or by
explicitly specifying start and end times.

<a name="SESSION_YEAR" default="$Y+0"></a>
<a name="SESSION_STRG" default="$S+0"></a>
<p><b>Year and Session identifier:</b>
You may specify one session from the <a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session table</a>.
The boundaries of this session define the observation window. If you use an
open session table the year has to be specified in addition to the session
identifier. If you use a fixed session table the year is read from the session
definition and the value in the panel is ignored.
<br>
It is possible to specify a range of sessions using the corresponding
menu variable (<tt>$S+-</tt>). In this case the time window starts at the
beginning of the first session of the range and stops at the end of the last
session of the range. If you use an open session table the year should also
be given with the range variable (<tt>$Y+-</tt>).

<p><i>Default values:</i> Year: <tt>$Y+0</tt> session: <tt>$S+0</tt>

<a name="STADAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="STATIM" default="00 00 00"></a>
<a name="ENDDAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="ENDTIM" default="23 59 59"></a>
<p><b>Start and End times:</b>
Specify date and time for the begin and the end of the observation window.
<br>
To specify a time window which is open on one side of the interval,
leave the corresponding input field for the start/end date empty. The
associated start/end time is then ignored.

<p><i>Default values for daily processing:</i> Start date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
start time: 00&nbsp;00&nbsp;00, end date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
end time: 23&nbsp;59&nbsp;59

<p><b>CODSPP 4: Screening Options</b>

<a name="ITRMAX" default="10"></a>
<p><b>ITERATIONS</b>
<p><b>Max. number of iterations:</b>
Coordinates and receiver clock errors are estimated iteratively. This
is necessary in particular if the a priori coordinates are of bad
quality. With this option you may set the number of iterations to 1
if you already have very good coordinates to speed up the processing.
The clock corrections are then computed from the observed-computed
(o-c) values and the residuals will be set to the o-c values, too.
The iterative process is stopped, if the coordinate changes are below
half a meter even if the maximum number of iterations is not yet
reached. The actual number of iterations performed is given in the
output file.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>10</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="OUTDET" default="1"></a>
<p><b>OUTLIER DETECTION</b>
<p><b>Outlier detection:</b>
The checkbox allows to switch the outlier detection algorithm on or off.
Depending on whether you are working in the kinematic mode or not different
outlier detection algorithms with different options will be applied.
<p>
In the non-kinematic mode an
observation will be considered as an outlier and not be used in the
parameter estimation, if the observed-computed value (o-c) differs (a)
by more than the value specified in the field "Max. residual allowed"
from the mean o-c value of all satellites of this epoch and (b) by more
than n times the RMS of the o-c values of one epoch or more than n times
the RMS a posteriori from the previous iteration, where the value for n is
entered in the field "Confidence interval". If only a few satellites (e.g., 2
or 3) are available most of the time or if the a priori coordinates are very
bad, the outlier detection might not work in a reliable way.
<br>
If you use CODSPP to get a priori clocks for a baseline processing using
phase data only you should work with a weak outlier rejection threshold
because you have to keep in mind that an epoch where CODSPP could not
compute an a priori clock value for the station will be lost for all
further processing.
<br>
On the other hand you may use CODSPP as a screening tool for the
pseudo-range observations. Because the noise level of the raw code
measurements from various receiver types may be very different
the use of "Station sigma factors" in section "INPUT FILES" is
highly recommended in this case. If you are using smoothed code from program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a> the use of the sigma factors for the
rescaling of the outlier rejection threshold is not required.
<br>
A sigma factor larger than 1.000 is multiplied with the threshold
specified in the field "Max. residual allowed" to obtain
the effective outlier rejection threshold for the respective station.
A sigma factor below 1.000 is set to 1.000. For stations not
included in the station sigma file the sigma factor is set to 1.000.
<br>
In the kinematic mode outlier detection is performed epoch by epoch.
In a first step an epoch-solution is computed iteratively.
If the RMS of this solution is larger
than the value specified in the field "Max. RMS of kin. solution" a
search for the worst satellite is initiated. The satellite is identified
which leads to the maximum improvement of the solution if its observation is
not contributing. This procedure is repeated until an
acceptable solution is found or the redundancy becomes smaller than the value
specified in the field "Min. degree of freedom". If the latter case no
epoch-solution is computed and all observations of the corresponding epoch
are marked.
<br>
If you unmark this checkbox, the following options are of no importance.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<a name="RESMAX" default="30.0"></a>
<p><b>Max. residual allowed: </b>
This option defines the maximum absolute value for a residual (more
precisely the o-c level, see above). Observations with residuals exceeding
this threshold undergo additional tests based on the value for n specified
in the following option "Confidence interval". When you are going to
analyze old data (with SA is turned on), the outlier detection level might
be set to a higher value (e.g., 100 meters).
<br>
If you are using CODSPP as a screening tool for pseudo-range
observations you can decrease this value to 3.0 meter.
<br>
By introducing a file in the field "Station sigma
factors" the threshold value may be adapted to the code noise of the
receivers at individual stations.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>30.0 </tt>meters

<a name="CONFIN" default="5.0"></a>
<p><b>Confidence interval:</b>
This option makes sure that observations are not eliminated because
of satellite clock, site coordinate, and orbit errors (see option
"Outlier detection" above).
<br>
If you are going to use CODSPP as a screening tool for pseudo-range
observations you can decrease this value to 3.0.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5.0</tt>

<a name="KINDOF" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Min. degree of freedom</b>
This option defines the minimal redundancy which must be given in order
to compute an epoch-solution in the kinematic mode. A value
of 0 means that epoch solutions are calculated even without any
redundancy, i.e., with only 4 satellites available.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1</tt>

<a name="KINSIG" default="5.0"></a>
<p><b>Max. RMS of kin. solution</b>
This option defines the screening threshold for outlier detection when
estimating kinematic coordinates. Because the noise level of the raw
code measurements from different receiver types may be very different
the use of "Station sigma factors" (see "INPUT FILES" section)
is highly recommended as long as you do not use
smoothed code observations obtained from the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a>.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5.0</tt>

<a name="OUTLSAVE" default="CODE"></a>
<p><b>Mark outliers in obs. files:</b>
If an outlier detection was done the bad observations may be marked in the
code (<b>CODE</b>), phase (<b>PHASE</b>), or code as well as phase (<b>BOTH</b>)
observation files. Specify "NO" to prevent marking of the bad observations
in the files.
<br>
Usually only the code observations should be marked because the outlier
detection is done for this observation type only. If you don't use the
code observation files in further processing it is not necessary to
mark the bad observation; you may specify <b>NO</b>. Marking bad code observations
also in the phase observation files may be helpful if you want to use
a combination between the code and phase observations in your processing
(e.g., Melbourne-Wuebbena-linear combination).
