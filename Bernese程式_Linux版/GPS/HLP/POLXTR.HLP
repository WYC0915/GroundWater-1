<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
This program may be used to extract Earth rotation parameter (ERP) information
from a list of consecutive pole files in the IERS format (see
<a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.IEP">Example</a> from CODE).
The user may specify which records in the original pole files
should be extracted and from which records the UT1-UTC values are integrated
into a continuous series.

<p><b>INPUT POLE FILES (IERS)</b>
<p><b>Individual files:</b>
Select the pole files (e.g. consecutive daily or <nobr>3-day</nobr> solutions)
from which a series of Earth rotation parameters should be extracted.
The files selected have to be ordered in time and it is not allowed to
have gaps in the pole file series (because of the integration of UT1-UTC).

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The menu establishes an alphabetical order of the input files.

<a name="RADIO_L" default="0"></a>
<a name="EPLIST" default=""></a>
<p><b>List of files:</b>
In this field you may specify the name of a file containing a blank-separated
list of the input pole files together with the records to be extracted.
The files selected have to be ordered in time and it is not allowed to
have gaps in the pole file series (because of the integration of UT1-UTC).

<a name="POLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>A priori pole file:</b>
You may select an a priori pole file for comparison purposes. The ERPs
of the extracted/integrated series will be compared to the ERPs in the
a priori pole file and both values will be written to the output plot file.

<a name="PLOTSKL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Plot skeleton file:</b>
If you would like to get a plot file you may enter the name of a plot
skeleton file here. An example of a plot skeleton file for SAS plots
is given in <a href="/$X/SKL/POLXTRPS.SKL">POLXTRPS.SKL</a>. Other plot
packages are currently not supported.

<a name="SYSODEF" default="1"></a>
<a name="SYSOUT"  default="POLXTR"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<p><hr>

<p><b>POLXTR 3: Options</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment in the program output
and will be saved in all the result files to document the program run.
The title should characterize the program run by, e.g., giving the most
important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="UT1TYP" default="IERS"></a>
<p><b>HANDLING OF UT1-UTC</b>
<p><b>Handling of UT1-UTC:</b>
There are three options on how the UT1-UTC values for the result
files are computed.
<ul>
<li><b>IERS:</b>
    This option is used for the submissions of ERP results to IERS.
    UT1-UTC is initialized with record 1 (see below) of the second
    Earth rotation parameter file (IEP). The value of UT1-UTC for the
    middle of the next day is then computed using the two records
    "UT1-UTC integration 1" and "UT1-UTC integration 2" specified below.
<li><b>ORBGEN:</b>
    This option is normally used to create a pole file to be used for
    long arcs in the program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ORBGEN">ORBGEN</a>.
    In this case the option "Number of epochs per day written" should be
    set to 3 and three records from each ERP
    input file (records 2,3,4 below) will be written to the output file.
    UT1-UTC is made continuous and the first value is initialized with
    the value in the a priori pole file.
<li><b>NON:</b>
    The UT1-UTC values for the middle epochs (record 3 below) are set to
    the values of the a priori pole file for each day. The UT1-UTC
    values for record 2 and 4 (if option "Number of epochs per day written"
    is set to 3) are aligned
    in such a way, that the UT1-UTC drift is the same in the resulting
    ERP file as it is in the daily ERP input files.
</ul>

<a name="OUTEPO" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Number of epochs per day written:</b>
This option decides, whether one or three records are written to the
ERP output files per input file. This option is not available if
"Handling of UT1-UTC" is set to "IERS". In this case one epoch per
day is written.

<a name="ANCHOR" default="FIRST"></a>
<p><b>Anchor epoch to a priori file:</b>
With this option you may specify whether the anchor epoch for UT1-UTC
(starting point for integration of UT1-UTC) is the first or the last file.
This option is only available if "Handling of UT1-UTC" is set to "ORBGEN".
In other cases the UT1-UTC time series is anchored at the first epoch.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>FIRST</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="OFFSET" default="0"></a>
<p><b>OFFSETS</b>
<p><b>Average of records 2 and 4:</b>
If this option is enabled the offsets for x-pole, y-pole, UT1-UTC are
not computed from record 3 of the input files but from the average of
records 2 and 4. If the extraction scheme does not correspond to the
ERP parametrization continuity of the ERPs may be enforced.
This option is only available if "Handling of UT1-UTC" is set to "ORBGEN".

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<br><br>

<a name="PRED" default="0"></a>
<a name="NPREDAY" default="0"></a>
<p><b>PREDICTION OF ERPs</b>
<p><b>Number of days:</b>
Number of days to be predicted using a polynomial fit through the
ERP values read from record 3 (see below) of each input file. If zero
days are entered, no prediction takes place.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0</tt>

<a name="PREDAPR" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Consider a priori as prediction:</b>
With this option enabled the a priori pole values are used as prediction
for the number of days specified in "Number of days" or the number of
days available in the file, whatever number is smaller. The values are
shifted by a constant offsets in order to align the prediction with the
last observed values.

<a name="NFITDAY" default="5"></a>
<p><b>Number of days to use for fit:</b>
Number of days, counted backwards from the last available value, to be used
for the polynomial fit. If option
"Consider a priori as prediction" is enabled the number of days is counted
backwards from the last epoch available in the a priori pole file.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5</tt>

<a name="NPREDEG" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Polynomial degree:</b>
Degree of polynomial used to predict the ERP values.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1</tt>

<p><b>POLXTR 4.1: Records to Extract</b>

<a name="RECORD1" default=""></a>
<p><b>RECORD NUMBERS TO BE USED</b>
<p>
The records in the IERS pole file (excluding any header lines) are
numbered sequentially for references below. The recommended values for
the extraction of <nobr>1-day</nobr> and <nobr>3-day</nobr> solutions and
other CODE solution types are given in the panel.
In the following five fields you specify the default
values for the numbers of the records to be extracted.

<p><b>UT1-UTC integration 1:</b>
The UT1-UTC value in the record number entered here will be used
together with the value in the record number given in the field
"UT1-UTC integration 2" to compute the UT1-UTC drift and to do the
integration of UT1-UTC. This record is only used if the option
"Handling of UT1-UTC" is set to "IERS".

<a name="RECORD2" default=""></a>
<p><b>Daily drift 1:</b>
If "IERS" is selected above, the daily drifts in the pole coordinates
and in UT1-UTC given in the IERS pole format are computed from the two
records given in the field here and the field "Daily drift 2" below.
If "ORBGEN" or "NON" is selected and if "Number of epochs per day written"
above is set to 3, the values of this record are written to the result file.

<a name="RECORD3" default=""></a>
<p><b>X,Y pole values:</b>
The x,y pole values in the resulting series are taken from the record
entered here unless option "Average of records 2 and 4" above is activated.

<a name="RECORD4" default=""></a>
<p><b>Daily drift 2:</b>
See option "Daily drift 1".

<a name="RECORD5" default=""></a>
<p><b>UT1-UTC integration 2:</b>
See option "UT1-UTC integration 1". This record is only used if the
option "Handling of UT1-UTC" is set to "IERS".
