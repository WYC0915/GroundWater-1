<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION </b>
<p>
The program checks the phase observations for cycle slips based on the
phase L1 and L2 observations and the pseudo-range observations P1 and P2.
Under AS regime C1 is used if P1 is not available.
<br>
The program does not need geometry information (neither station coordinates,
satellite orbits, nor clock information). It compares only the four
observations per epoch to each satellite (code and phase for both frequencies)
using different linear combinations. The screening procedure handles the
data independently for each satellite arc.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The algorithm does not allow to use the program for single frequency or code
only receivers.
<br>
First the Melbourne-Wuebbena linear combination of phase and code
observations is screened for outliers and jumps (cycle slips).
If cycle slips were detected the phase observations are checked in the
geometry free linear combination (L4) to determine
the size of the cycle slip. Finally a screening of the ionosphere-free
linear combination (<nobr>L3-P3</nobr>) is performed to detect
remaining outliers which are caused by 'blunders' in the code observations.
<br>
After having obtained a clean data set in this way the code observations are
smoothed using the phase observations. In principle the code observations are
replaced by the phase observations correcting for the opposite sign of the
ionosphere and using the absolute value of the code.
<br>
Cycle slips will be flagged in the resulting RINEX file. Cycle slips may be
repaired only in code observations but never in phase observations.
<br>
If an outlier was detected in the procedure described above all four
observations (code and phase on both frequencies) are flagged by
setting the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the resulting smoothed
RINEX file to '1'. Epochs where a cycle slip was detected are indicated
by a SNR of '5' and the loss of lock (LLI) indicator is set to one.
All other epochs are flagged with an SNR of '9'. If the user decides to
copy the code or phase observations from the input RINEX observation file
all corresponding measurements will be marked with a SNR of '2'.
In <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RXOBV3">RXOBV3</a>
bad observations may be excluded by selecting an appropriate minimal SNR level.

<a name="RNXFIL" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Original RINEX observation files:</b>
Select the original RINEX observation files to be processed. Several files may
be processed in the same program run. The resulting smoothed RINEX files will
have the same names but with a different extension (default extension SMT).
<br>
Select the value for the two digit year in the extension for original RINEX
observation files using the dialogue
<a href="SETDATE.HLP">Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Set session/compute day</a>.

<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in <b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>,
option "Maximum program output file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.

<br><br>

<a name="ESTDCB" default="NO"></a>
<p><b>DIRECT ESTIMATION OF DIFFERENTIAL CODE BIAS VALUES</b>
<p><b>Estimate P1-C1 and P2-C2 DCB values:</b>
Estimate <nobr>P1-C1</nobr> and <nobr>P2-C2</nobr> DCB values, depending on
the availability of both P1 and C1, or both P2 and C2 observation data.
DCB result files are output with respect to each considered RINEX input file
(using the same filename). If this option is marked, no SMT files are generated.

<p><i>Default value:</i> NO

<p><b>RNXSMT 1.1: General Files</b>

<a name="CONST" default="CONST."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>General constants:</b>
This file contains all the physical and astronomical constants used
in the Bernese GNSS Software. Most probably you will never have to
modify this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">CONST.</a>

<a name="SATELL" default="SATELLIT.I08"></a>
<p><b>Satellite information:</b>
This file contains general information on GNSS (and LEO/GEO) satellites.
For the session to be processed,
each satellite has to appear once in this file
within a corresponding time window.

<p><i>Note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08 is maintained by AIUB/CODE.
It includes a complete history concerning the GPS satellite constellation
(and newly launched satellites are regularly added).
You can get the latest version of this file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
If the information record for a satellite is missing in
this file for the measurement epoch the corresponding observations are
skipped. Consequently they are not in the resulting smoothed RINEX file.
A warning message is issued in that case.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">SATELLIT.I08</a>

<a name="SATCRUX" default="SAT_$Y+0"></a>
<p><b>Satellite problems:</b>
This file contains information on satellite problems concerning modeling.
It is used for exclusion of misbehaving satellites
(and for orbit arc splitting).
It may also contain (mean) epochs of GPS repositioning events.

<p><i>Note:</i>
Corresponding year-specific files are maintained by AIUB/CODE.
You can get the latest version of the current file from the
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_AIUB_AFTP.TXT">anonymous ftp</a> account of AIUB.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/SAT_2011.CRX">SAT_2011.CRX</a>

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>SAT_$Y+0</tt>

<a name="GEOSFILE" default=""></a>
<p><b>Giove observation types:</b>
This optional file allows to explicitly define a satellite-specific observation
type selection (e.g., if different observation types should be used for GIOVE or
Galileo IOV satellites or if the same observation types shall be used for all
satellites or a group of satellites). Observations of satellites not listed
in the file will be skipped. The code and phase observations
for two frequencies are expected to be written in RINEX3 notation. This option
works only for RINEX3 observation files and is deactivated if P1-C1 DCBs are
estimated. This option deactivates the keyword "OBSSEL" (observation type
priority file).

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/OBSEXAMP.GFS">OBSEXAMP.GFS</a>

<a name="OBSSEL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Observation types priority:</b>
This file defines the priority of the GNSS observation types available in the
RINEX observation files. BSW 5.x supports dual-frequency GNSS data processing
(i.e., phase observations for two frequency channels L1 and L2 and code
observations for two channels C1 and C2). If this file is defined the
program will select those observation types with the highest priority (defined
in this file) and the best availability (according to a satellite-wise
availability statistics computed by the program). The observation type priority
may be defined in a system-specific, satellite-specific, and/or
receiver-(group)-specific way. If a certain receiver type is not listed in this
file, the program will use the settings for the "DEFAULT" receiver. The use of
this file is optional for RINEX2, and mandatory for RINEX2.12 observation files.
When using RINEX3 observation files either this observation type priority file
or a satellite-specific observation selection file (keyword "GEOSFILE") must be
defined. The observation types in this file are expected to be in RINEX3 notation.
This option is deactivated if P1-C1 DCBs are estimated or a satellite-specific
observation selection file (keyword "GEOSFILE") is used.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/DOC/OBSEXAMP.SEL">OBSEXAMP.SEL</a>

<p><b>Print selection:</b>
If an observation type priority file (keyword "OBSSEL") is used, an observation
type availability statistics and a list of the selected observation types can
be printed into the output file by activating this checkbox.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<p><hr>

<p><b>RNXSMT 2.1: Options</b>

<a name="TITLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
<p>
This title line will be printed as header comment into the program output
and saved in the resulting smoothed RINEX observation files
to document the program run. The title should characterize the program run by,
e.g., giving the most important options used and the session.

<br><br>

<a name="MAXREC" default="3000"></a>
<p><b>OBSERVATION ARC DEFINITION</b>
<p><b>Maximum number of records in a RINEX file:</b>
This number is used to allocate arrays to buffer the observations from each
input RINEX file. Each observation epoch in the RINEX file is counted as
one record.

<p><i>Note:</i> The sampling interval and the observation window that may be
defined below as user input is considered when counting the records.

<p><i>Default value:</i> 3000 for a RINEX file containing 24&nbsp;hours with a
30&nbsp;seconds sampling

<a name="SAMPL" default="30.0"></a>
<p><b>Sampling interval for RINEX data:</b>
Each RINEX file is completely read into the computer memory. Therefore,
the number of epochs processed simultaneously is limited to the "Maximum
number of records in a RINEX file" specified above. If you
have too many epochs you may either sample the data or cut the RINEX
observation file using the program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#CCRINEXO">CCRINEXO</a>.
<br>
The sampling interval cannot be longer than the sampling for the processing
you want to use in the following processing steps. For the data screening,
the cycle slip correction, and the code smoothing the sampling interval should
not be selected much longer than a few minutes.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>30.0 seconds</tt>

<a name="USEWIN" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Use observation window:</b>
Usually all observations in the original RINEX files are processed.
Mark this checkbox to enter a time window for the observations to be processed.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="RMSTON" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Skip observations with S1 and S2=0.000:</b>
If a RINEX file contains signal-to-noise ratio as observations (data types:
S1/S2) and both values are zero in the observation record this indicates
a potential problem when tracking the corresponding satellite. If this
checkbox is marked the corresponding observations are not considered for
further processing in program RNXSMT.
<br>
As a verification for the reliability of this observation type it is
required that at least one S1 or S2 measurement per epoch has to be different
from zero.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<a name="USEC2" default="0"</a>
<p><b>Use C2 if P2 unavailable:</b>
Marking this checkbox will allow the program to use C2&nbsp;observations if
P2&nbsp;observations are not available.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="GAPARC" default="180.0"></a>
<p><b>Maximum gap in data to start a new arc:</b>
If the observations have a time gap larger than the specified value,
a new arc is started for the screening (a new ambiguity is set up for the phase
observations).

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>180.0 seconds</tt>

<a name="MINOBS" default="10"></a>
<p><b>Minimum number of observations per arc:</b>
The minimum number of observations per arc is used to remove short arcs.
The reason for a short arc are either some isolated observations or some
remaining observations of a bad arc. The data screening and the code
smoothing algorithm are not reliable for a few epochs only.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>10</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="EPOFLAG" default="SKIP"></a>
<p><b>EVENT FLAG HANDLING</b>
<p><b>What to do in case of event flags:</b>
RINEX observation files may contain event flags. A flag 4 means that an
additional RINEX header (or a part of a RINEX header) follows. All other
flags (e.g., start moving antenna, or new site occupation) are not handled
by RNXSMT. If such an event flag is found in the input RINEX file the selection
for this option specifies:
<ul>
<li><b>WARNING:</b> to ignore the record of the epoch flag and to continue the
        processing of the RINEX file.</li>
<li><b>SKIP:</b> to skip the RINEX file in the processing and to continues
        the processing with the next RINEX input file in the list.</li>
<li><b>ERROR:</b> to stop the program with an error.</li>
</ul>
The program issues a warning resp. an error message in any case.

<br><br>

<a name="CLKEVT" default="50.0"></a>
<p><b>DETECT CLOCK EVENTS</b>
<p><b>Minimum size of a clock event:</b>
Before the program starts to analyze the satellite arcs the consistency of
the code and phase measurements for all epochs is checked. We can
assume that the mean change of the ionospheric-free linear combination
from one epoch to the next is the same for code and phase measurements
(as far as the satellite constellation does not change). Satellites may be
excluded if they exceed a threshold of four times
the "RMS of an arc in ionosphere free LC (L3-P3)"
(specified on panel 4 in section "IONOSPHERE-FREE LINEAR COMBINATION:
OUTLIER DETECTION").
<br>
If the epoch-to-epoch difference for the code and phase measurements
exceed the value specified in this input field an event in the receiver
clock is assumed which shows a different magnitude for the code and phase
measurements (this is not consistent with the RINEX standards but
unfortunately it happens from time to time). The handling of this receiver
clock event for the processing is defined with the option "Tolerance for
ms-jump detection" below.
<br>
An empty input field disables the detection of clock events. As a
consequence the entire satellite arc may be removed as bad.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>50 nanoseconds</tt>

<a name="CYCEVT" default="0.001"></a>
<p><b>Tolerance for ms-jump detection:</b>
The algorithm how a receiver clock event is detected is described for the option
"Minimum size of a clock event" above. If the magnitude of the clock event is
an integer number of milliseconds (within the tolerance defined in this
input field) the phase measurements starting with this epoch are corrected
for this integer number of milliseconds to recover the consistency of code
and phase measurements. If a clock event of a different magnitude has been
detected new phase ambiguities for all satellites need to be setup. RNXSMT
breaks all satellite arcs at the particular epoch.
<br>
If the input field remains empty the arcs are broken for all clock events.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0.001 milliseconds</tt>

<a name="MAXEVT" default="50">
<p><b>Maximum number of events allowed per file:</b>
The algorithm how a receiver clock event is detected is described for the option
"Minimum size of a clock event". A huge number of clock events may indicate
a malfunction of the receiver (or the RINEX converter). If the number of
detected receiver clock events exceeds the limit specified in this input
field the processing of the RINEX input file is stopped, a warning message is
issued, and no smoothed output RINEX file is generated.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>50</tt> (assuming 24 hour RINEX files)

<p><hr>

<p><b>RNXSMT 2.2: Observation Window</b>

<a name="RADIO_1" default="1"></a>
<a name="RADIO_2" default="0"></a>
<p><b>OBSERVATION WINDOW</b>
<p>
This panel allows to specify a time window. Only observations within this time
window will be used for processing.
<br>
You may define the time window either by using session definitions, or by
explicitly specifying start and end times.

<a name="SESSION_YEAR" default="$Y+0"></a>
<a name="SESSION_STRG" default="$S+0"></a>
<p><b>Year and Session identifier:</b>
You may specify one session from the <a href="SESSIONS.HLP">session table</a>.
The boundaries of this session define the observation window. If you use an
open session table the year has to be specified in addition to the session
identifier. If you use a fixed session table the year is read from the session
definition and the value in the panel is ignored.
<br>
It is possible to specify a range of sessions using the corresponding
menu variable (<tt>$S+-</tt>). In this case the time window starts at the
beginning of the first session of the range and stops at the end of the last
session of the range. If you use an open session table the year should also
be given with the range variable (<tt>$Y+-</tt>).

<p><i>Default values:</i> Year: <tt>$Y+0</tt> session: <tt>$S+0</tt>

<a name="STADAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="STATIM" default="00 00 00"></a>
<a name="ENDDAT" default="$YMD_STR+0"></a>
<a name="ENDTIM" default="23 59 59"></a>
<p><b>Start and End times:</b>
Specify date and time for the begin and the end of the observation window.
<br>
To specify a time window which is open on one side of the interval,
leave the corresponding input field for the start/end date empty. The
associated start/end time is then ignored.

<p><i>Default values for daily processing:</i> Start date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,
start time: <tt>00&nbsp;00&nbsp;00</tt>, end date: <tt>$YMD_STR+0</tt>,

<p><b>RNXSMT 3: Screening Options</b>

<a name="RMSL5" default="0.60"></a>
<p><b>MELBOURNE-WUEBBENA LINEAR COMBINATION: SCREENING, CYCLE SLIP DETECTION</b>
<p><b>RMS of a clean arc for Melbourne-Wuebbena:</b>
The Melbourne-Wuebbena linear combination is screened both for outliers
and jumps (cycle slips). For this purpose the RMS of the observation arc
is determined.
Here you can specify the maximum RMS for a 'clean' arc. If this RMS is
exceeded a cycle slip search is started. After all cycle slips have been
detected the observations will be screened for outliers until the RMS is
lower than the specified value.
<br>
Note that the noise of the Melbourne-Wuebbena linear combination is
dominated by the code observation noise. For receivers with good code
observation and/or non-AS conditions a value of <tt>0.4</tt> L5 cycles is
reasonable.
For other receivers the value should be increased (note that using a larger
noise level some cycle slips may not be detected.
<br>
If the program is used to smooth the code observations a higher value
is not critical. However, if clean phase data is desired a high value might
result in undetected cycle slips. A low value may result in many deleted
observations. For smoothed code a value of up to <tt>0.8</tt> L5 cycles may be used.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0.60</tt> L5 cycles

<a name="SLPMIN" default="1.0"></a>
<p><b>Minimum size of detectable cycle slips:</b>
Due to code observation noise (e.g., under AS conditions) it might be difficult
to reliably detect small cycle slips. Therefore the minimum size can be set
here.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>1.0</tt> L5 cycles

<a name="SLPOUT" default="5.0"></a>
<p><b>Minimum size of detectable outliers:</b>
Specify the outlier detection level for the first Melbourne-Wuebbena screening
step. However this level is not fix. The size will be dynamically reduced by
the program until the specified "RMS of a clean arc for Melbourne-Wuebbena"
level has been reached.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>5.0</tt> L5 cycles

<br><br>

<a name="GAPL4" default="180.0"></a>
<p><b>GEOMETRY-FREE LINEAR COMBINATION: CYCLE SLIP CORRECTION</b>
<p><b>Maximum gap for cycle slip correction:</b>
If cycle slips are detected in the Melbourne-Wuebbena linear combination
the geometry free linear combination (L4) is used to estimate the size of
the cycle slip. Here you specify how large the gap between the last
observation before the cycle slip and the epoch of the cycle slip may be.
If the gap is larger than the specified value no cycle slip repair will
be attempted.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>180.0 seconds </tt>

<a name="MINL4" default="10"></a>
<p><b>Number of L4 observations for fit:</b>
For the cycle slip correction using the geometry free linear combination (L4)
two linear fits are made (before and after the cycle slip event). Specify
the number of observations which should be fitted.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>10</tt>

<a name="RMSL4" default="0.01"></a>
<p><b>RMS of L4 for fit and cycle slip correction:</b>
If cycle slips are detected the geometry free linear combination (L4) will
be used to determine their sizes. For this purpose a linear fit is computed
for a certain number (specified under "Number of L4 observations for fit")
of observations before and after the cycle slip event. The RMS of this linear
fit has to be lower than the specified RMS to accept the fit for the cycle
slip correction.
<br>
In a second step the difference of the two linear polynomials at the
cycle slip epoch is computed. This difference must be lower than the
specified RMS value as well. Otherwise the cycle slip size is not computed.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0.01 meters</tt>

<a name="FIXSLP" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Fix cycle slips in code observations:</b>
If a cycle slip is detected the corresponding observation epoch will be
flagged in the resulting RINEX file. Using this option one may choose whether
to fix the cycle slip for the smoothed code or not (cycle slips in phase
observations are never fixed).
<br>
The advantage of fixing cycle slips is a longer observation arc.
The obvious disadvantage is that the determined size of the cycle slip
may be wrong. If cycle slips are not corrected the observation arc is
divided in two parts at the corresponding epoch.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<br><br>

<a name="RMSL3" default="2.0"></a>
<p><b>IONOSPHERE-FREE LINEAR COMBINATION: OUTLIER DETECTION</b>
<p><b>RMS of an arc in ionosphere free LC (L3-P3):</b>
After screening the Melbourne-Wuebbena and geometry free (L4) linear
combinations everything should be fine. However, due to severe code
observation 'blunders' a few outliers may still remain. Therefore an additional
outlier screening is performed using the ionosphere free combination
(<nobr>L3-P3</nobr>).
Outliers are removed until the RMS of the observation arc is lower than the
specified value.
<br>
Again the noise of this combination is determined by the code observations.
To get sound smoothed code observations use a value somewhere between
<tt>1.2</tt> and <tt>2.4</tt>&nbsp;meters. A good 'rule of thumb' is to set this
value to a factor four times larger than the "RMS of a clean arc for
Melbourne-Wuebbena".

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>2.0 meters</tt>

<p><hr>

<p><b>RNXSMT 4: Output Options</b>

<a name="FLGPHS" default="1"></a>
<p><b>OUTPUT OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Preprocess phase observations:</b>
The program RNXSMT tends to throw away quite a lot of data. About 10% more
than, e.g., program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#MAUPRP">MAUPRP</a> does.
<br>
This option allows to copy the original phase data into the resulting
smoothed RINEX file (checkbox unmarked). This is useful if you want to use
smoothed code but original
phase observations. An example might be the use of smoothed code for ambiguity
resolution using a Melbourne-Wuebbena strategy.
<br>
Note that bad observations are flagged by setting the signal to noise
code to '1'. If phase observations are copied from the input file this code is set
to '2' for all phase observations.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked for zero difference applications using phase
measurements; unmarked if only the smoothed code will be used

<a name="FLGCOD" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Use smoothed instead of raw code:</b>
Specify if the smoothed or raw code observations should be saved in the
resulting RINEX files.
<br>
In the case of smoothed code the signal to noise ratio is used to indicate
bad observations ('1'), applied cycle slip corrections ('5'), and good
observations ('9'). The raw code observations are a copy from the input
RINEX observation file indicated by a signal to noise ratio flag of '2'.
<br>
If you want to process code and phase data together you should use
raw code measurements. If you want to use only code observations the smoothed
code measurements may provide better results.
<br>
Because the noise level of the code measurements of different receiver
types may be different the use of station observation sigma factors is
recommended if you are going to use the raw code observations for the data
analysis in program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#GPSEST">GPSEST</a>.

<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<a name="PRTFLG" default="SUM"></a>
<p><b>Output detail:</b>
Choose if only a summary should be written to the program output file
or if a detailed output should be printed.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>SUM</tt>

<br><br>

<a name="GLOFRQ" default="0"></a>
<p><b>SPECIAL OPTION</b>
<p><b>Verify GLONASS frequency number:</b>
If you are not sure that the frequency number for the GLONASS
measurements in the satellite information file is correct or if you want to
verify the frequency really used by the receiver you may check this box.
<br>
The program runs through the screening procedure trying all GLONASS
frequency numbers from <tt>-7</tt> to <tt>24</tt>. It assumes that the
frequency number with the biggest number of valid observations after the
screening procedure has been used by the receiver. It is compared in the
program output to the default frequency number given in the satellite
information file.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The resulting smoothed RINEX file is generated in any case
with the default frequency number from the satellite information file.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unchecked
