<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
The program GPSEST is the main parameter estimation program of the
Bernese GNSS Software. It allows the estimation of the following
parameter types:
<br>
<br>&nbsp; 1. station coordinates,
<br>&nbsp; 2. receiver clock parameters (including GPS/GLONASS clock biases),
<br>&nbsp; 3. orbital elements,
<br>&nbsp; 4. ambiguities,
<br>&nbsp; 5. receiver antenna offsets,
<br>&nbsp; 6. troposphere parameters for individual stations,
<!--
<br>&nbsp; 7. local ionosphere model parameters,
-->
<br>&nbsp; 8. differential code biases (DCBs),
<!--
<br>&nbsp; 9. local troposphere model parameters,
-->
<br>      10. Earth rotation parameters (ERPs),
<br>      11. stochastic orbit parameters,
<br>      12. satellite antenna offsets,
<!--
<br>      13. Earth potential parameters,
<br>      14. resonance terms,
<br>      15. albedo parameters,
-->
<br>      16. Geocenter coordinates,
<br>      17. stochastic ionosphere parameters,
<br>      18. receiver antenna phase center variations,
<br>      19. global (and station-specific) ionosphere model parameters,
<br>      21. epoch-specific station coordinates,
<br>      22. Scaling factors for Vienna grid file,
<br>      23. epoch-specific station clocks,
<br>      24. epoch-specific satellite clocks, and
<br>      25. satellite antenna phase center variations
<br>      26. range bias parameters,
<br>      27. scaling factors for higher-order ionosphere corrections,
<br>      30. GNSS-specific station translations and troposphere biases
<p>
based on a least-squares adjustment using undifferenced (zero-difference)
or double-differenced phase or/and code measurements (interferometric
processing technique). Note that the numbers above correspond to the
internally used parameter type numbers.
<p>
In addition, you have the possibility to combine GPSEST results on the
normal equation (NEQ) level using the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a>. If you intend to make use of this
option please note that
<ul>
<li>you have to set up all requested parameters in the GPSEST runs and that
<li>you have to save the complete associated variance-covariance information
    (see option "NORMAL EQUATION SYSTEM" in panel "GPSEST 2.1: Output Files 1").
</ul>
<p>
The program GPSEST is capable of processing GPS-only, GLONASS-only, as
well as GPS/GLONASS-combined data for stationary, kinematic, or spaceborne
receivers. Furthermore, SLR range measurements may be processed.

<a name="PSFILES" default="????$S+0"></a>
<a name="PZFILES" default="????$S+0"></a>
<p><b>OBSERVATION FILES</b>
<p><b>Phase observations:</b>
Select Bernese formatted phase observation file(s) to be processed. Several
files (baselines/stations) may be processed in the same program run.
<ul>
  <li><b>DOUBLE:</b>
     Internally from the selected single differences formed double
     differences which are used for the actual estimation.
  <li><b>ZERO:</b>
     A zero difference network solution or precise point positioning
     solution is computed from the selected files.
</ul>

<a name="CSFILES" default=""></a>
<a name="CZFILES" default=""></a>
<p><b>Code observations:</b>
Select Bernese formatted phase observation file(s) to be processed. Several
files (baselines/stations) may be processed in the same program run.
<ul>
  <li><b>DOUBLE:</b>
     Internally from the selected single differences formed double 
     differences which are used for the actual estimation.
     <br>
     If you want to resolve wide-lane ambiguities analyzing the so-called
     Melbourne-Wuebbena linear combination of phase and (precise) code
     measurements, you have to select the same code single difference files you
     selected for the phases. The code and phase baseline definitions have to be
     identical in this case (see program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#SNGDIF">SNGDIF</a>).
  <li><b>ZERO:</b>
     The code zero difference files can, e.g., be used to estimate station and 
     satellite clocks epoch wise or to compute ionosphere models.
</ul>

<a name="RZFILES" default=""></a>
<p><b>Range observations:</b>
Select the SLR range observation file(s) to be processed. Several
files may be processed in the same program run.


<br><br>


<a name="COORD" default=""></a>
<p><b>MAIN INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Station coordinates:</b>
Select an a priori coordinate file which contains all the sites you are
processing. The a priori coordinates should be known within a few
centimeters, otherwise you may do an additional iteration by introducing the
saved coordinate estimates as new a priori values.
<br>
<a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.CRD">Example</a>


<a name="STDORB" default=""></a>
<p><b>Satellite standard orbits:</b>
Select one standard orbit file containing the information on the satellite
positions. Note that the orbit file specified has to cover all observation
epochs to be processed.


<a name="POLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>Earth rotation parameters:</b>
This file contains the Earth rotation parameters (ERP's). It is used for
the transformations between the International Celestial Reference Frame
(ICRF) and the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). This
file has to be identical to the one used for the computation of the standard
orbit.
<br>
<a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ERP">Example</a>


<a name="SATCLK" default=""></a>
<p><b>Satellite clock corrections:</b>
Selection of a satellite clock file is recommended only if there is a
problem in terms of the receiver clock synchronization.
In case of zero-difference processing
you will have to include a priori satellite clock information.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE1.CLK">Example</a>


<a name="DCBINP" default=""></a>
<p><b>Differential code biases:</b>
Selection of a code bias input file containing differential (P1-P2 or P1-C1)
code biases of satellites and/or receivers is generally recommended. These
biases are irrelevant only when processing the L3 linear combination of code
measurements from P1/P2 (not C1/X2 or C1/P2) receivers. If L1, L2, or even
L5 is processed, precise satellite clocks (option "GNSS clock
corrections") as well as ionosphere models (option "Ionosphere models") should
be taken into account.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.DCB">Example</a>


<a name="VMF1_FILES" default=""></a>
<p><b>Gridded VMF1 coefficients:</b>
To choose the Vienna Mapping Function VMF1
(see <a href="REFERENCES.HLP#Boehm2004">B&ouml;hm et al, 2004)</a>
several coefficients are needed.
These files can be downloaded from yearly subdirectories
(see <a href="LINKS.HLP#VMF1">VMF1</a>). There are provided grid
files every 6&nbsp;hours. You may either select a set of grid files covering
the full time-span of the data processed or you may also copy all these files
together into one file that is specified here.
<br>
To select a proper grid file here is the pre-requirement for choosing
<tt>VMF</tt> for "ZPD model and mapping function" in panel "GPSEST 3.2:
General Options 2".

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMP_VMF1.GRD">Example</a>


<a name="IONOS" default=""></a>
<p><b>Ionosphere models:</b>
Selection of an ionosphere file containing local or global/regional
ionosphere models is recommended when doing ambiguity resolution without
using code measurements or when producing single-frequency solutions
(e.g. with L1 measurements only). When processing the ionosphere-free (L3)
linear combination you obviously do not need to specify any ionosphere
model.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE2.ION">Example</a>


<br><br>


<a name="OCNLOAD" default=""></a>
<p><b>CORRECTIONS FOR LOADING EFFECTS AND CENTER OF MASS</b>
<p><b>Ocean tidal loading:</b>
If desired,
a file containing the ocean loading amplitudes and phases may be specified.
The format is the 'de facto' IERS standard.

<p><i>Note:</i>
For instructions on how to get ocean loading coefficients
for a set of (new) points please be referred to
<a href="/$X/DOC/README_BLQ.TXT">IGSMAIL-3521</a>.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.BLQ">Example</a>


<a name="ATMLOAD" default=""></a>
<p><b>Atmospheric tidal loading:</b>
A file with atmospheric tidal loading corrections may be selected to correct
the observations for this effect.
<br>
The file becomes mandatory if you use a Standard orbit with CMC applied.
Be sure to select the same file as for the programs used to generate the
orbit file.
<br>
<i>Remark:</i>
This file can be generated by the program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#GRDS1S2">GRDS1S2</a>

<p><b>GPSEST 1.2: Input Files 2</b>

<a name="RPRCOE" default=""></a>
<p><b>ADDITIONAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Satellite orbit partials:</b>
The selection of a file containing the partial derivatives of the orbital
parameters is only necessary if you want to improve GNSS orbits in this run
(see option "Orbital parameters", panel "GPSEST 5.1: Setup of
Parameters and Pre-Elimination 1". The file is generated with program
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#ORBGEN">ORBGEN</a>.

<a name="RXCLKIN" default=""></a>
<p><b>Clock RINEX file:</b>
An input clock RINEX file can be selected to introduce (consistent) receiver
and satellite clock corrections. The receiver clock corrections from this
file replace the values in the observation file for the processing.


<a name="ISBINP" default=""></a>
<p><b>Inter-system biases:</b>
Time-dependent inter-system biases can be introduced from a file into the
processing.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ISB">Example</a>


<a name="TROPEST" default=""></a>
<p><b>Troposphere estimates:</b>
Estimated troposphere values. Here you can input troposphere estimates
from previous GPSEST or <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a> runs or from
other source (e.g. CODE). Do <i>not</i> estimate troposphere corrections
while introducing estimated troposphere parameters as a priori information.
You may run into inconsistencies because of different mapping functions used
in the different steps.
<br>
For small networks, where the troposphere can be estimated only
differentially, it is very useful to include (absolute) troposphere
information for reference sites.
This information can be obtained, e.g., from CODE
(for a significant number of IGS sites).

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.TRP">Example</a>


<a name="METFIL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Meteorological data:</b>
Measured surface meteorological data may be used to compute the tropospheric
zenith delays. If meteorological data files (one file per station) are
specified. The estimated troposphere parameters entered with the file
specified in option "Troposphere estimates" in the previous panel have
precedence over values given in the files specified here.
<br>
Under most circumstances the estimation of troposphere (see option
"Site-specific troposphere parameters" in panel "GPSEST 5.1: Setup of
Parameters and Pre-Elimination 1") gives much better results than the use of
meteorological data to correct the tropospheric delays.

<a name="ALOAD_FILES" default=""></a>
<a name="ONTLD_FILES" default=""></a>
<a name="HLOAD_FILES" default=""></a>
<p><b>GRIDDED LOADING PARAMETERS</b>
Geometrical deformations of the Earth crust from any source can be introduced
as corrections for the station coordinates (analogue like solid Earth tides).
They are expected in global grids in the same format as the components of the
VMF. You have the opportunity to introduce three different sets of corrections
where the keyword <tt>! Data_types:</tt> is used to identify which type of
correction is expected in this particular file. The following keywords
correspond to the three types of corrections:
<ul>
<li>Atmospheric pressure: <tt>ATM-NT-LOAD</tt>
<li>Ocean, non-tidal: <tt>OCN-NT-LOAD</tt>
<li>Hydrostatic pressure: <tt>HYDR-LOAD</tt>
</ul>
Note that the program accepts only input files with the expected keywords in
the input field.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The name 'Vienna grid file' indicates only that the same
format as for the VMF corrections is used. It does not mean that the files
must be provided by the TU Vienna.

<p><i>Remark for advanced users:</i>
The values from the grid files are
simply applied to the coordinates. It means you can put any geometrical
corrections in one of these files.

<br><br>


<a name="STAINFO" default=""></a>
<p><b>AUXILIARY STATION FILES</b>
<p><b>Station information:</b>
This file contains station specific information. The program only considers
the marker types (TYPE 005) contained in this file.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.STA">Example</a>


<a name="KININP" default=""></a>
<p><b>Kinematic coordinates</b>
For kinematic station positioning it is possible to introduce kinematic
a priori coordinates. Usually it is a result from a former run of GPSEST
where the kinematic station positioning was stored in the file (see option
"Kinematic coordinates" in panel "GPSEST 2.2: Output Files 2").

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.KIN">Example</a>


<a name="ANTAZI" default=""></a>
<p><b>Receiver antenna orientation:</b>
Select a receiver antenna orientation file containing the azimuth of the
antenna orientations for each session, where any of the antennas was not
oriented to the north. This file is of special use if you have to process
antenna calibration campaigns, where the antennas were oriented differently
from session to session.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.AZI">Example</a>


<a name="STAWGT" default=""></a>
<p><b>Observation sigma factors:</b>
You may specify a file containing station observation sigma factors. It is
used for the station-specific weighting of observations and for the
rescaling of the edit level used for code observations in the zero
difference processing (see option "Maximum tolerated O-C term" in panel
"GPSEST 3.2: General Options 2").
<br>
Weighting of stations is important if you process pseudo-range
measurements from different receiver types in one program run because they
may have significantly different noise levels. If you use smoothed code from
program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#RNXSMT">RNXSMT</a> sigma factors for station
weighting are not necessary.
<br>
The majority of sigma factors contained in the observation sigma file
have to be close to unity. Otherwise the a priori sigma is rescaled.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.SOS">Example</a>



<a name="ECCENT" default=""></a>
<p><b>Station eccentricities:</b>
Optionally a site coordinate eccentricity file may be specified containing
local ties between markers.

<p><a href="/$X/DOC/EXAMPLE.ECC">Example</a>



<p><hr>

<p><b>GPSEST 1.3: LEO- and SLR-specific Input Files</b>

<a name="LEOSTD" default=""></a>
<p><b>LEO-SPECIFIC INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Standard orbits:</b>
Specify an a priori LEO standard orbit if you are processing spaceborne
GPS data.


<a name="LEORPR" default=""></a>
<p><b>Orbit partial derivatives:</b>
Specify the name of the file containing the partial derivatives of the
orbital if you are processing spaceborne GPS data and are estimating dynamic
or reduced-dynamic LEO orbits.


<a name="ATTIT" default=""></a>
<p><b>Attitude data:</b>
Specify the file containing the LEO attitude information. Original formats
from CHAMP and JASON may be read.


<a name="KINVEL" default=""></a>
<p><b>Kinematic velocities:</b>
Epoch-specific velocities might be helpful
for LEO-related applications.

<p><b>GPSEST 1.4: General Files</b>

<a name="CONST" default="CONST."></a>
<p><b>GENERAL INPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>General constants:</b>
This file contains all the physical and astronomical constants used
in the Bernese GNSS Software. Most probably you will never have to
modify this file.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">$X/GEN/CONST.</a>


<a name="DATUM" default="DATUM."></a>
<p><b>Geodetic datum:</b>
This file contains the definition of the geodetic datum and of the
ellipsoid to be used to compute ellipsoidal coordinates. It is used
to apply antenna heights and for the printing of coordinates in the
local system (north, east, up). You only have to modify this file
when you want to introduce a new reference ellipsoid.

<p><i>Caution:</i>
This file has no effect on Cartesian coordinates.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/DATUM.">$X/GEN/DATUM.</a>


<a name="PHASECC" default="PCV.I08"></a>
<p><b>Phase center variations:</b>
This file contains receiver antenna phase center offsets and optionally
elevation-dependent phase center patterns.
In addition, the file may contain satellite-specific antenna
phase center patterns (dependent on nadir angle) as well as offset values.
Corresponding offset (correction) values, however, are not yet considered
by the software.
The satellite antenna offset values applied correspond to
those given in <a href="/$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08">$X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08</a>.
<br>
You have to modify this file when you use a new antenna type
or when you wish to consider your own PCV calibrations.
The program <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ATX2PCV">ATX2PCV</a> allows to convert
PCV information given in ANTEX format into Bernese-formatted PCV tables.

<p><i>Important note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.REL contains PCV values
for most of the receiver antenna types commonly used
within IGS (and EUREF).
These PCV values are addressed as 'relative' values
as they are generally referred to
a specific receiver antenna type (AOAD/M_T).
For this reference antenna type
(as well as implicitly all GNSS antenna types),
PCV patterns are assumed to be nonexistent.
Sooner or later, it will become common to consider 'absolutely' calibrated
receiver and satellite antenna PCV values.
A corresponding file ($X/GEN/PHAS_IGS.ABS) will be made available
as soon as this is the case.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/PCV.I08">$X/GEN/PCV.I08</a>.


<a name="RECEIVR" default="RECEIVER."></a>
<p><b>Receiver information:</b>
This file contains in essence the code measurement types for a list of
receivers. These specifications are relevant when considering so-called
differential (P1-P2 or P1-C1) code biases.

<p>Example: <a href="/$X/GEN/RECEIVER.">$X/GEN/RECEIVER.</a>


<a name="SATELL" default="SATELLIT.I08"></a>
<p><b>Satellite information:</b>
This file contains general information on GNSS (and LEO/GEO) satellites.
For the session to be processed,
each satellite has to appear once in this file
within a corresponding time window.

<p><i>Note:</i>
The file $X/GEN/SATELLIT.I08 is maintained by AIUB/CODE.
It includes a complete history concerning the GPS satellite constellation

<p><b>GPSEST 1.5: Array Dimension Specification</b>
<p><a name="SHOWMAX" default="0"></a>
   <a name="MAXLOC" default=""></a>
   <a name="MAXFIL" default=""></a>
   <a name="MAXSTA" default=""></a>
   <a name="MAXSAT" default=""></a>
   <a name="MAXAMB" default=""></a>
   <a name="MAXPAR" default=""></a>
   <a name="MAXFLS" default=""></a>
   <a name="MAXSAS" default=""></a>
   <a name="MAXAMP" default=""></a>
   <a name="MAXSNG" default=""></a>
<b>MAXIMUM ARRAY DIMENSIONS</b>
<p>
The dimension of the main arrays are adjusted from the input files and
input options. In this way the memory occupied by the program during the
run-time can be limited to a minimum.
<br>
Most of the arrays are critical for the amount of memory needed by the
program for execution. So the adjusted values are limited by the built-in
default settings defined according to your memory model (file
<tt>${I}/P_GPSEST.f90</tt>). This is done to avoid unintentional program runs
(e.g., the huge number of epoch parameters are not preeliminated epoch-wise).
<br>For test solutions it may be useful to define the arrays with an increased
dimension for one or more parameters (e.g., introducing an observation file
for five days with more ambiguities per file as usual). If you specify a
value in the input field the dimension of the corresponding arrays are set
to your input value (independent from the adjusted size).
<br>
In detail the dimensions you may specify are:
<ul>
<li><b>MAXLOC:</b> Maximum number of parameters to be processed
    <br>
    Number of all parameters to be setup. In the case of epoch-wise
    preelimination only the epoch parameters from one epoch are counted.
<li><b>MAXFIL:</b> Maximum number of files to be processed
    <br>
    Number of code and phase files selected either for zero or double
    difference processing.
<li><b>MAXSTA:</b> Maximum number of stations involved
    <br>
    Total number stations from all selected observation files.
<li><b>MAXSAT:</b> Maximum number of satellites involved
    <br>
    Total number satellites from all selected observation files. The
    number does not consider the selection for the option
    "Satellite system" in panel "GPSEST 3.1: General Options 1".
<li><b>MAXAMB:</b> Maximum number of ambiguities in an observation file
<li><b>MAXPAR:</b> Maximum number of parameters simultaneously processed
    <br>
    Number of parameters that have to be hold in the design matrix
    at the same time. Parameters that are preeliminated EVERY_SESSION
    or EVERY_EPOCH give their position in the design matrix free when
    the next session or epoch is processed.

<p><b>OBSERVATION SELECTION</b>
<p><b>Satellite system:</b>
Observation data from a specific satellite system may be selected here.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>ALL</tt>

<p><a name="FREQUENCY" default="L3"></a>
<p><b>Frequency/linear combination:</b>
Here you may select one or two frequencies (linear combinations) to
be processed.
<ul>
<li><b>L1</b>: First frequency.
  <br>
  This frequency is the first choice when processing
  'small' high-precision control networks (with an extent of few
  kilometers only) taking into account local or global/regional
  ionosphere models.
<li><b>L2</b>: Second frequency.
<li><b>L3</b>: Ionosphere-free linear combination (LC) of dual-band
    measurements.
    <br>
    This LC - which nearly completely eliminates the ionospheric refraction
    effects - is recommended to be used for most networks. By introducing
    already resolved wide-lane (L5) ambiguities you get an observable which
    may be used to resolve the so-called narrow-lane (L1) ambiguities. One
    narrow-lane cycle corresponds to a wavelength of about 11 cm only.
    Please note that 'L3-ambiguities' are real-valued when no wide-lane
    (L5) ambiguities are introduced, i.e., in this case ambiguity
    resolution cannot be done!
<li><b>L4</b>: Geometry-free LC of dual-band measurements
    <br>
    which corresponds to the
    difference L1-L2 (in meters). This LC is useful when monitoring the
    deterministic component of the ionosphere and recommended when
    producing ionosphere models and estimating differential (P1-P2) code
    biases, respectively.</li>
<li><b>L5</b>: Wide-lane LC of dual-band measurements.
    <br>
    In principle this LC is
    only used to resolve the wide-lane (L5) ambiguities without code
    measurements on 'medium' baselines (with lengths of few hundred
    kilometers only). One wide-lane cycle corresponds to a wavelength
    of about 86 cm which is quite large compared to the ionospheric
    (and tropospheric) biases expected. The site coordinates should
    be fixed to a previously computed L3-solution, when resolving the
    wide-lane ambiguities.
<li><b>L1&amp;L2</b>: Both frequencies.
    <br>
    The parallel processing of both frequencies is
    recommended when resolving ambiguities with
    the SEARCH strategy. For the QIF strategy both frequencies have
    to be processed in parallel and the setting of L1&amp;L2 is
    mandatory.</li>
<li><b>L3&amp;L4</b>: Ionosphere-free and geometry-free LCs.
    <br>
    Please do not use.
<li><b>MELWUEBB</b>:
    Melbourne-Wuebbena linear combination of dual-band phase and code
    measurements
    <br>
    is recommended to be used when resolving the wide-lane
    (L5) ambiguities with 'precise' code measurements. This LC is free
    of hypotheses concerning the ionosphere and the 'geometry' - where
    'geometry' includes the troposphere, the satellite orbits (and
    clocks) as well as the station coordinates (and clocks).
    In order to use this option you have to select both,
    phase <i>and</i> code single-difference files in option "GPSEST 1.1: Input Files 1".
<li><b>DTEC</b>:
    Squared temporal differences of the geometry-free LC.
    <br>
    This kind of
    observable can be used to map the stochastic component of the
    ionosphere.
</ul>

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>L3</tt>

<a name="MINEL" default="3"></a>
<p><b>Elevation cutoff angle:</b>
Only phase/code observations above the elevation cut-off angle
specified here will be used in the parameter estimation program
for ground-based receivers.
If you process low-elevation data (below 15 degrees), an
elevation-dependent observation weighting model should be activated (see
option "Elevation-dependent weighting" below).
<br>
If you specify <tt>0</tt> (zero) here,
all elevation angles will be accepted.
This may be helpful if you have really bad a priori coordinates.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>3</tt>&nbsp;degrees

<a name="SAMPLE" default=""></a>
<p><b>Sampling interval:</b>
You may wish to process sampled observation epochs, i.e. only one
epoch per n&nbsp;seconds. This time span can be specified here. If <tt>0</tt> is
entered no data sampling will be done, i.e., all observation epochs
will be used. In many cases the processing time may be considerably
reduced by sampling the data without loss of accuracy.
<br>
If you store residual to screen the data using the programs
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#RESRMS">RESRMS</a> and
<a href="PGMLST.HLP#SATMRK">SATMRK</a> please
keep in mind that you get residuals only for those observations
corresponding to the sampling rate specified here. If you choose another
value than <tt>0</tt> observations between the sampling epochs are <i>not</i>
screened.
<br>
The same holds for parameters pre-eliminated EVERY_EPOCH and back-substituted
(namely, receiver and satellite clock corrections or kinematic coordinates).

<p><i>Default value:</i> blank or <tt>0</tt>&nbsp;seconds (all observations)

<a name="CORRINTV" default="100"></a>
<p><b>Tolerance for simultaneity:</b>
The correlation matrix will be computed for all the observations that
are 'simultaneous', where simultaneous is defined by the time
interval specified here. If you are processing 1 sec data you better
change the time interval to a fraction of a second, else observations
that belong to different epochs might be processed together and thus
correlated.
<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>100</tt>&nbsp;milliseconds

<a name="SODSEL" default="NO"></a>
<p><b>Special data selection:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>NIGHT-TIME</b>:
    To process night-time data only might be a way to get more reliable
    differential code biases because of a temperate ionospheric climate on
    the obscured hemisphere.
<li><b>NON-ECLIPSING</b>:
    The option removes satellite data from start of the eclipse
    until 30 minutes after returning to sunlight, e.g., to study orbit
    modelling problems.
<li><b>SPEC.NON-ECL</b>:
    By eliminating data from eclipsing satellites (only Block I, Block II
    and IIA satellites) the effect of non-predictable attitude motions of
    those satellites may be excluded.
</ul>
<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>NO</tt>

<a name="WINDOW" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Observation window:</b>
If you switch this option on an additional panel will be displayed where you
may enter the observation window to be processed. Otherwise all observations
will be processed.
<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<br><br>

<a name="SIGAPR1" default="0.001"></a>
<p><b>OBSERVATION MODELING AND PARAMETER ESTIMATION</b>
<p><b>A priori sigma of unit weight:</b>
Here you may specify the a priori sigma of unit weight, where the
unit weight usually corresponds to the weight of the zero-difference
L1 phase observable (at zenith). The a priori weights for the L1
phase and code observable are defined in the file
<a href="/$X/GEN/CONST.">$X/GEN/CONST.</a>.
<br>
The a priori sigma should approximately agree with the actual
measurement noise of the one-way L1 phase observations (the post-fit
sigma of unit weight given in the GPSEST output file).
The value of this sigma is relevant only for the correct scaling of
any a priori sigmas put on specific parameters. When changing the
a priori sigma here, you also change the strength of the a priori
constraints defined.
<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0.001</tt>&nbsp;meter
(<tt>0.002</tt>&nbsp;meter if no elevation-dependent weighting activated)

<a name="ELVWGT" default="COSZ"></a>
<p><b>Elevation-dependent weighting</b>
This option allows you to specify a model for the elevation-dependent
weighting of the observations when processing data from ground-based
receivers. The elevation-dependent weighting is
valid for each of the correlation strategies you may choose above.
<ul>
<li><b>NO</b>: All observations are equally weighted.
<li><b>COSZ</b>: Model 1 weighting function: cos(z)**2.
<li><b>COS2Z</b>: Model 2 weighting function: cos(z)**4.
<li><b>COS2C</b>: Model 1 (cos(z)**2) is applied to the
phase measurements whereas model 2 (cos(z)**4) is used for
the code observations.
</ul>
For test purposes the user may define his own weighting functions
by modifying the subroutine <tt>WGTELV</tt>.
<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>COSZ</tt>

<a name="NORRES" default="NORMALIZED"></a>
<p><b>Type of computed residuals:</b>
<ul>
<li>The <b>REAL</b> residuals correspond exactly to the adjusted minus actual
    observations in each case. Vice versa, the actual observation vector
    plus the REAL residual vector gives the adjusted observation vector.</li>
<li>The <b>NORMALIZED</b> residuals are REAL residuals divided by the square
    root of the diagonal element of the co-factor matrix of the residuals
    - the difference between the inverse weighting matrix of the actual
    observations and the co-factor matrix of the adjusted observations.
    In contrast to REAL residuals, NORMALIZED residuals are always
    converted to one-way L1 carrier phase residuals, i.e., if you divide
    these residuals by the post-fit sigma of unit weight, you should get
    random variables with a standard deviation of 1.
    <br>
    If you want to detect outliers reliably using the program
    <a href="RESRMS.HLP">RESRMS</a> when analyzing low-elevation data,
    applying an elevation-dependent observation weighting model,
    introducing satellite-specific weights, or introducing station
    observation sigma factors, it is recommended to save NORMALIZED
    residuals.
<li>The <b>NORM_APRIORI</b> residuals correspond to NORMALIZED residuals
    scaled with the a priori (not post-fit) sigma of unit weight.
    This option may be useful in case of the presence of (pre-eliminated)
    epoch parameters.
</ul>
Please be aware that, e.g., a REAL double-difference L3 carrier phase
residual of 36 mm corresponds to a NORMALIZED (one-way L1-)residual of
6 mm - assuming that no elevation- or satellite-specific weighting took
place.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>NORMALIZED</tt>

<a name="CORREL" default="CORRECT"></a>
<p><b>Correlation strategy:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>CORRECT</b>:
    The mathematical correlations between the double-difference
    observations are handled correctly even when processing several
    baselines of a network. This correlation strategy is recommended
    when producing 'final' solutions, because mathematically and
    statistically it is the correct method to use. If more than about
    30-40 sites are processed with correct correlations, the resources
    needed by GPSEST (CPU time, memory, etc.) might become critical.
    A comprise consists of a processing in clusters of sites with full
    correlations taken into account within each cluster.
    <br>
    All the observation files of one session are open simultaneously
    when using CORRECT.
    Correlations between different linear combinations are also
    correctly modeled (e.g. when processing L1 for some baselines and
    L3 for others).</li>
<li><b>FREQUENCY</b>:
    With this option correlations are correctly handled within each
    linear combination or frequency. When processing L1 baselines and
    L3 baselines together the correlations within the L1 baselines
    and the correlations within the L3 baselines are dealt with separately.
    This option was sometimes used to avoid, that the scale in
    the L1 baselines (due to the ionosphere) would affect the L3 baselines
    through the correlations. A better method is the use of an
    appropriate ionosphere model to get rid of the scale and to process
    the network with correct correlations.</li>
<li><b>BASELINE</b>:
    Only the correlations within each baseline are correctly modeled.
    Specifying BASELINE also means, that each baseline is processed
    sequentially (and not in parallel as in the case of correct
    correlations). Each single difference file is then considered to
    be one session internally. Especially when pre-eliminating
    ambiguities this 'baseline mode'
    is very efficient, because it only needs space in memory for the
    ambiguity parameters of one baseline. After one baseline has been
    processed the ambiguities are pre-eliminated from the normal
    equation system and the ambiguity parameters of the next baseline
    may use their space.</li>
</ul>
If <i>zero-difference observations</i> are processed no mathematical
correlations between observations exist. Nevertheless the correlation
strategy CORRECT has to be used as soon as satellite clocks are estimated or
code and phase observations are processed together because in both cases the
observation files from the different stations resp. observation types have
to be processed simultaneously.
<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>CORRECT</tt>

<p><b>LEO-SPECIFIC SELECTION AND MODELING OPTIONS</b>

<a name="LEOEDW" default="NONE"></a>

<p><b>HANDLING OF AMBIGUITIES</b>
<p><b>Resolution strategy:</b>
Initial carrier phase ambiguities may be resolved/handled in several
ways. Note that ambiguity resolution is usually done baseline by
baseline.
<br>
If you process GLONASS-only or GPS/GLONASS-combined data, the
following ambiguity resolution/handling strategies may be used:
NONE, ROUND, SIGMA, QIF, and LAMBDA . All these strategies work with
all possible linear combinations, except for WUEBB.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>NONE</b>:
    Ambiguity resolution is not attempted.
<li><b>ROUND</b>:
    The simplest ambiguity resolution (AR) strategy which only rounds
    the real-valued estimates to their nearest integers without using
    any variance-covariance information.
<li><b>SEARCH</b>:
    The general search strategy includes essential elements of the
    Fast Ambiguity Resolution Algorithm (FARA) but is generalized to be
    applicable for all linear combinations. This AR strategy is very
    powerful for data taken in the rapid static observation scenario
    (with L1&amp;L2) or the re-occupation scenario (with L1&amp;L2 or only
    L1).
    <br>
    Attention: SEARCH is not GLONASS-capable.
<li><b>SIGMA</b>:
    The sigma-dependent strategy makes use of the full variance-covariance
    information. This 'standard' AR strategy is useful for
    linear combinations like L1, L2, L3 (with wide-lane), L5,
    L1&amp;L2, and WUEBB.
<li><b>QIF</b>:
    The Quasi-Ionosphere-Free (QIF) AR strategy allows to directly
    resolve L1 and L2 ambiguities even on long baselines (with lengths
    up to 1000/2000 kilometers) without using the code measurements.
    Note that this AR strategy requires in addition the estimation of
    stochastic ionosphere parameters (panel "GPSEST 5.1: Setup of Parameters
    and Pre-Elimination 1", section "EPOCH PARAMETERS"). L1 and L2
    observations have to be processed in parallel.
    <br>
    Attention: In case of GLONASS, QIF is restricted by default to
    ambiguities of the same frequency channels.
<li><b>LAMBDA</b>:
    Multi-GNSS capable LAMBDA ambiguity resolution is not yet
    available (but is intended to be part of a next software update).
</ul>
<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>NONE</tt>

<a name="SATSYS_AR" default="ALL"></a>

<a name="AMBQCPB" default="ALWAYS"></a>
<p><b>Consider GPS quarter-cycle biases:</b>
GPS quarter-cycle biases may be present between L2P and L2C
(potentially collected for GPS Block IIR-M and IIF). Such biases have
been observed for JAVAD, LEICA, NOV receivers. You may select three
levels of bias handling (from safe to unsafe):
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>ALWAYS</b>:
    Tread ambiguity parameters belonging to the mentioned GPS satellite
    generations always as (unresolved) bias parameters if a receiver of
    the mentioned receiver group is involved.
<li><b>IF_INDICATED</b>:
    Just tread one ambiguity parameter belonging to the mentioned GPS satellite
    generations as (unresolved) bias parameter if a receiver of
    the mentioned receiver group is involved.
<li><b>NEVER</b>:
    Completely ignored GPS quarter-cycle bias issue.
<li><b>PRN</b>:
    By specifying a particular PRN number, ambiguities belonging to this
    PRN number may be excluded from ambiguity resolution (for test
    purposes).
</ul>

<a name="AMBSAVE" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Save resolved ambiguities:</b>
To save the integer values of resolved ambiguities (L1/L2 or L5) in

<a name="APRWIDE" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Introduce widelane integers:</b>
To introduce the previously resolved wide-lane ambiguities is
necessary when resolving narrow-lane ambiguities with L3. After
successfully resolving L5 (wide-lane) and L1 (narrow-lane)
ambiguities this option may be unmarked and the option
"Introduce L1 and L2 integers" below may be marked to produce an
ambiguity-fixed solution.

<a name="APRL1L2" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Introduce L1 and L2 integers:</b>
You may produce
<ul>
<li>an ambiguity-free solution by unmarking the checkbox or
<li>an ambiguity-fixed solution by marking the checkbox, if L1 and L2/L5
    ambiguities are already resolved.
</ul>
We recommend to produce an ambiguity-fixed solution as final solution
by introducing the known integers.

<a name="OBS2NEQ" default="0"></a>
<p><b>SPECIAL PROCESSING OPTIONS</b>
<p><b>Stop program after NEQ saving:</b>
If you check this box no solution is computed for this program run.
The normal equation is setup and is directly written into the NEQ file.
If you are not interested in the solution you
can spare the computing time for inverting the normal equation in GPSEST
(typical application: generation of NEQ files for several clusters where
you are not really interested in the solution of each individual cluster
but only in the solution of the combination of all clusters that is
computed later on in <a href="PGMLST.HLP#ADDNEQ2">ADDNEQ2</a>).
<br>
Of course, no output files are written in the program run apart from
the "NORMAL EQUATION SYSTEM" file.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
The option is not available in the case of ambiguity
resolution because the solution of the normal equation system is necessary.
Furthermore, the preelimination of parameters "PRIOR_TO_NEQ_SAVING" is
ignored because it is equivalent to "EVERY_SESSION" if no solution is computed.

<p><b>OPTIONS AND CRITERIA FOR TESTING:</b>
<p><b>Baseline-wise ambiguity resolution:</b>
Ambiguity resolution using the general search strategy is recommended
to be done baseline by baseline. In this case the normal equation

using the complete normal equation system. You may ignore this option
when you process an individual baseline only.

<a name="IFSWID" default="5.0"></a>
<p><b>Search width in units of standard deviation:</b>
To quantify the search range for all ambiguity parameters (and all
possible differences including wide-lane ambiguities) you may specify
a search width in units of standard deviations which should correspond
to the factor of the Student t-distribution function as a function of
degree of freedom and a significance level which has to be assumed.
To find the true set of integers
<ol>
<li>all compatible ambiguity vectors are generated after statistically
    testing all possible values, differences, and geometry-free LCs,
<li>for each accepted ambiguity vector a least-squares adjustment is
    performed, and finally
<li>the ambiguity vectors are sorted according to their resulting RMS error.
</ol>
At the end the ambiguity vector of the best solution (with the smallest
RMS) has to fulfill two additional statistical tests to be accepted
as the true one - otherwise the ambiguity resolution has failed.

<p><b>Maximum allowed RMS ratio re fixed to float:</b>
The ratio between the a posteriori RMS errors of the (best)

<p><b>Maximal number of ambiguities fixed per iteration step:</b>
Maximum number of ambiguities to be solved in one iteration step. After
each iteration step an inversion of the complete normal equation matrix
is done once again holding the resolved ambiguities on their integer
values. In this way we increase the chance of the remaining ambiguity
parameters to be resolved because of the decreasing formal accuracies
of the ambiguities with increasing degree of freedom.
<br>
By entering <tt>0</tt> all ambiguity parameters which fulfill the resolution
criteria specified below are fixed in one step. Even in this case
additional ambiguity pairs may be resolved in further iteration steps
due to the boot-strapping mentioned above.
<p>
<i>Remark:</i> If GLONASS ambiguities are resolved we can only resolve
one ambiguity per iteration. The program adjusts the setting automatically
in this case (issuing a warning message).

<p><b>Ambiguity resolvable if exactly one integer within:</b>
Ambiguities are solvable if exactly one integer lies within the
two-tailed confidence interval based on the real-valued estimates, the
a posteriori RMS errors, and the factor of the Student t-distribution

<a name="MOST" default="0.07"></a>
<p><b>Maximal sigma of resolvable ambiguities:</b>
All possible double-difference ambiguity parameters with an RMS error
smaller than the maximal sigma specified here (in units of cycles
of the observable processed) are first sorted according to their RMS
errors. Note that the wavelengths of the mostly formed linear
combinations are about 19.0 cm for L1, 24.4 cm for L2, 86.2 cm for
the wide-lane LC (L5), and 10.6 cm for the narrow-lane LC (L3 with
introduced L5 ambiguities).
<br>
Starting with the ambiguity parameter with the best RMS error the
ambiguity resolution algorithm tests whether the associated fractional
part is smaller than the maximal sigma entered here. Otherwise the next
double-difference ambiguity from the sorted list is checked in the
same way, and so on.

<p><b>Minimal sigma used for testing:</b>
In addition you may define a minimum sigma which is used in the
statistical test if the RMS error of an ambiguity is smaller than
this limit. This is necessary, because often the formal RMS errors
are too small and obviously resolvable ambiguities will remain
unresolved due to the sigma-dependent test (see option

<p><b>GPSEST 5.1: Setup of Parameters and Pre-Elimination 1</b>
<p>
This and the following panel allow to set up parameters for estimation as
well as to specify whether and at which stage of the processing they shall
be pre-eliminated. To set up a specific parameter type activate the
corresponding checkbox. The checkbox may be inactive if for a specific
configuration of input files. It is, e.g., not possible to estimate clock
parameters if single-difference files are specified as input, or orbit
estimation is not possible if no file containing partials is specified.
<br>
Pre-elimination is useful, e.g., to reduce the size of the output NEQ or
to increase processing speed. If, e.g., you do not wish to have site
troposphere parameters explicitly in your stored NEQ file, use option
PRIOR_TO_NEQ_SAVING for this parameter type. In this way, you may drastically
reduce the size of your NEQ files. Please note that all pre-eliminated
parameters are internally included in the least-squares adjustment scheme.
<br>
Be careful in selecting appropriate constraints when pre-eliminating
parameters and saving normal equation files. The parameters remain, with the
constraints applied, implicitly in the system. The constraints are 'frozen
in' in the output NEQs and can never be modified again.
<br>
Please note that, if one or more parameter types are pre-eliminated at
any stage, it is no longer possible to save residuals in a residual file
(except for epoch-wise preelimination).
<br>
In case of normal equation storing you have to pre-eliminate the
ambiguity parameters.

<p>The following pre-elimination options are available:
<ul>
<li><b>NO:</b>
    The parameters are not pre-eliminated and remain explicitly in
    the system. They appear in the solution and in the normal equation
    file if an output file is specified.
    </li>
<li><b>EVERY_EPOCH:</b>
    Parameters are pre-eliminated epoch by epoch. This option is only
    available for epoch parameters, i.e., for kinematic station coordinates,
    receiver and satellite clock corrections, and stochastic ionosphere
    parameters.
<li><b>AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE:</b>
    Ambiguity parameters are pre-eliminated as soon as they are replaced
    by a new ambiguity for the same station-satellite combination. This
    option is only available for ambiguity parameters.
<li><b>EVERY_SESSION:</b>
    Parameters are pre-eliminated for each session or, for baseline-wise
    processing, for each baseline. Correlations between parameters from
    different sessions are thus neglected. The parameters are already
    pre-eliminated when the complete normal equation matrix is inverted
    ('before inversion'), i.e. they are not contained in the solution
    vector and thus their estimates are not available for the user.
    </li>
<li><b>PRIOR_TO_NEQ_SAVING:</b>
    Parameters are pre-eliminated after the inversion of the full normal
    equation matrix but before saving of the output normal equation file.
    This option is useful, if you want to save a reduced normal equation
    system and still have the possibility to verify the estimates of the
    pre-eliminated parameters in the program output.
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="PRE01" default="NO"></a>
<p><b>STATION-RELATED PARAMETERS</b>
<p><b>Station coordinates:</b>
Station coordinates are set up in any case for all stations providing
observations. This option allows you to pre-eliminate station coordinates. 
The option may be reasonable only in very specific cases and is not
recommended to be used.
<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>NO</tt>


<a name="PRE04" default="AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE"></a>
<p><b>Ambiguities:</b>
In general, phase ambiguity parameters may be pre-eliminated because their
values are not of particular interest.
If normal equations are saved, the parameters <i>must</i> be pre-eliminated.
When saving a residual file, however,
pre-elimination of ambiguity parameters is not permitted.
<br>
Which pre-elimination option is selected depends on the available
resources. More frequent pre-elimination (AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE)
requires less memory on the expense of processing time while less frequent
pre-elimination needs more memory but is more efficient with respect to
computing time.
To perform ambiguity parameter pre-elimination just every n seconds,
a corresponding number, n, might be entered in the input field. 
<br><i>Note:</i>
If ambiguity resolution is activated,
either NO or PRIOR_TO_NEQ_SAVING may be selected.
The latter possibility enables (in principle) saving of a NEQ file 
directly from a GPSEST run dedicated to ambiguity resolution.

<p><b>TIME OFFSET FOR PARAMETER INTERVALS</b>
<p>
Time dependent parameters such as
<ul>
<li>troposphere zenith path delays and gradient parameters,
<li>parameters for global ionosphere models, and
<li>Earth orientation parameters
</ul>
are modeled by linear functions within equally spaced epochs. The spacing of
these epochs can be specified individually for each of the above parameter
types. The parameter time intervals are usually computed in a way that they
are assigned to the beginning of the session. For special cases it is possible
to move all time intervals for all parameters by an offset given in this input
field.
<br>
If a time interval for a parameter type is longer than one session or one
session is not a multiple of the interval length the computation of the
parameter time intervals starts at the beginning of the session containing
the first epoch of all selected observations. If an offset is given in this
input field it is added. Starting from this epoch the time intervals are
added or subtracted n times until the observation interval is completely
covered. Therefore this epoch must not necessarily be within of close to
the observation interval; it can be an arbitrary interval.

<br><br>
<a name="MAPPNG" default="WET_GMF"></a>
<p><b>ZENITH PATH DELAY PARAMETERS</b>
<p>
Troposphere parameters should always be estimated if the session is
longer than about 1 hour. Troposphere parameters should not be
estimated for rapid-static data or if L4 or the Melbourne/Wuebbena
linear combination is processed. Troposphere zenith path delay and gradient
parameters are modeled as piece-wise linear (i.e., continuous) functions.

<p><b>Mapping function:</b>
Mapping function used for the computation of the partial derivatives
of the troposphere zenith delay parameters (not for the a priori
troposphere model). We recommend to use WET_VMF or WET_GMF in combination with
the option DRY_VMF or DRY_GMF respectively in for the a priori troposphere model (option
"ZPD model and mapping function" in panel "GPSEST 3.2: General Options 2").
<br>
For compatibility reasons the older mapping functions COSZ, HOPFIELD, DRY_NIELL, and WET_NIELL
are still supported.
<br><i>Note:</i> When applying the WET_VMF or DRY_VMF specific files containing
"Gridded VMF1 coefficients" need to be specified in panel "GPSEST 1.1: Input Files 1".

are set up in addition to the zenith component. The estimation of
tropospheric gradient parameters is recommended only when producing
regional or global network solutions, not single baselines.
<ul>
  <li><b>NONE</b>: Only zenith path delay parameters are set up.
  <li><b>TILTING</b>:
      The zenith to which the mapping function is related to is tilted.
      The tilting angles are implicitly described by two gradient
      parameters in north and east directions.

<p><b>A PRIORI SIGMAS</b>
<p><b>Zenith path delay</b>/<b>Horizontal gradients:</b>
Two types of a priori sigma may be specified for troposphere parameter
estimations:
<ul>
<li><b>Absolute</b>:
  Here you may specify 'absolute' a priori constraints on the values of
  the tropospheric zenith path delay/horizontal gradient parameters
  (with respect to the a
  priori model specified in option "ZPD model and mapping function" in
  panel "GPSEST 3.2: General Options 2". If you enter blank or <tt>0.0</tt>, no
  absolute sigmas will be applied.
  <br>Please note that too strong 'absolute' constraining of troposphere
  parameters can cause significant scale biases.
  <br><i>Default value:</i> blank
<li><b>Relative</b>:
  In addition you may specify so-called 'relative' constraints on the
  differences between consecutive tropospheric parameters referring to
  the same station to model/limit the variation of tropospheric
  parameters in time. Relative constraining only make sense if the
  troposphere estimation interval is shorter than about 30 minutes.
  <br><i>Remark:</i> In order to avoid a format overflow in the troposphere
  output file that may happen if a troposphere parameter is estimated based on
  very few observations concentrated at one end of the interval of parameter
  validity, a small relative sigma (e.g., 5&nbsp;meter) may help.

<p><b>OPTIONS SPECIFIC TO EPOCH PARAMETERS</b>
<p>The following panel contains options only relevant for the epoch-wise 
pre-elimination and back-substitution of epoch parameters. It is only
displayed if you have selected "EPOCH PARAMETERS" in panel "GPSEST 5.1: 
Setup of Parameters and Pre-Elimination 1" with pre-elimination
strategy EVERY_EPOCH.

<a name="PHASEPO" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Epoch parameters only from phase:</b>
If the code and phase measurements are introduced both measurement types are
used to compute the parameters. If you check this box for the back-substitution
step only the phase data are considered but the code observations are skipped.
<br>
This is in particular useful when you compute clock corrections: you
use first code and phase data to solve for the parameters of the main
NEQ but in the back-substitution step the clocks of the epochs are only
computed from the phase data. This prevents the generation of 'code-only'
clocks if all phase observations of a certain station/satellite are marked
for a particular epoch.

<p><i>Remark:</i>
Because no code data are considered in the back-substitution
step also no residual are available for these measurements.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmark


<a name="QXXEPO" default="SIMPLIFIED"></a>
<p><b>Var-covar wrt epoch parameters:</b>
Correlations between pre-eliminated epoch parameters and the remaining
parameters may be neglected (<tt>SIMPLIFIED</tt>) or taken into account
(<tt>CORRECT</tt>) for subsequent re-substitution (of corresponding epoch
parameters).
Note that <tt>CORRECT</tt> may be very memory-intensive.

<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>SIMPLIFIED</tt>


<a name="SAMPLEPO" default=""></a>
<p><b>Sampling rate for resubstitution:</b>
Parameters pre-eliminated EVERY_EPOCH can be back-substituted (namely,
receiver and satellite clock corrections or kinematic coordinates) with a
different sampling of n&nbsp;seconds as the sampling of processed epoch.
It means that not for all epochs included in the processing a solution
from the back-substitution is generated.

<a name="SAMPLEP2" default=""></a>
<p><b>Sampling rate for pre-elimination:</b>

kept in the main normal equation (no epoch-wise pre-elimination) every
n&nbsp;seconds.
<br><i>Note</i> that only clock parameters may be stored in an output

<p><b>DATUM DEFINITION FOR CLOCK ESTIMATION</b>
<p><b>Type of datum definition:</b>
If you are estimating satellite and station clock corrections together you
have to define the datum of the clocks by selecting a reference clock or an
ensemble of reference clocks. With this option you specify the way the
reference clock shall be realized. In the following options you specify the
clocks that shall contribute to the definition of the reference.
<ul>
  <li><b>ZERO-MEAN_CONDITION</b>:
      The reference clock is realized as a zero-mean condition on the
      estimated improvements of the clock corrections for the clocks
      specified in the following options.
  <li><b>REFERENCE_FIXED</b>: 
      The clock corrections specified in the following options are kept on 
      their a priori value. No clock corrections are estimated for the
      reference clocks.
</ul>
If you estimate only satellite or only station clock corrections the reference
is defined by the clocks that are not estimated.

<a name="RCVCLKTYP" default="NON-GPS_SATELLITES"></a>
<p><b>GLONASS CLOCK ESTIMATION</b>
<p><b>GLONASS receiver clock biases</b>
When processing GPS and GLONASS observations togeher, an inter-system bias
per receiver need to be considered because we have to assume independent
hardware delays for each system. Because GLONASS emits the signal on
individual frequencies for the different satellites different hardware
delays in the receiver for the satellites (at least for those used different
frequencies) have to be introduced.
<br>
When processing phase measurements these biases are absorbed by the
ambiguity parameter. When processing code data we have to solve for these
differences in the hardware delay as inter-system and inter-frequency biases.
We can only solve for the sum of both biases.

<p><b>Parameter setup:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>NONE</b> No bias parameter is setup.
<li><b>NON-GPS_SATELLITES</b> Individual bias parameters for each of the
    GLONASS satellites are setup. No parameters for GPS satellites are
    estimated.
<li><b>FREQUENCY_SPECIFIC</b> Common bias parameters for GLONASS satellites
    with the same frequency number are setup. No parameters for GPS satellites
    are estimated.
<li><b>FREQ_SPEC_POLYNOM</b> Common bias parameters for GLONASS satellites are
    assumed. The biases are introduced as a polynomial (degree 4). This might
    be useful if the GLONASS constellation/network is weak since less parameters
    are estimated with respect to the FREQUENCY_SPECIFIC case.
<li><b>SATELLITE_SPECIFIC</b> Bias parameters for each satellite (GPS and
    GLONASS are setup.
</ul>
The last case is the most general one. It is mainly intended for research
purposes since for the GPS satellites are no significant biases between the
different satellites are found so far. When processing GLONASS code measurements
it is recommended to introduce biases for all NON-GPS_SATELLITES. It also allows
for differences in the biases between the two GLONASS satellites using the
same frequency number.
<br>
The necessary zero-mean condition for the improvements of all relevant
parameters are automatically applied.

<p><i>Remark:</i> Estimated bias parameters may be stored in "Differential code biases" 
output file (panel "GPSEST 2.2: Output Files 2"). They can also be estimated together
with other DCB parameters (panel "GPSEST 6.11: Differential Code Biases").

<p><b>GPSEST 6.10: Stochastic Ionosphere Parameters</b>

<a name="DIONELI" default="0"></a>
<p><b>STOCHASTIC IONOSPHERE PARAMETERS</b>
<p>
It is necessary to estimate stochastic ionosphere parameters if phase
ambiguities are resolved to integer using the QIF strategy (see panel
"GPSEST 3.2.4: Quasi-Ionosphere-Free Ambiguity Resolution Strategy").
In principle this parameter type allows - by varying the a priori
constraints - to continuously switch between a pure L1&amp;L2 solution
and an ionosphere-free L3 solution. Due to the potentially large number
of parameters stochastic ionosphere parameters have in general to be
pre-eliminated epoch-wise.

<p><b>Elimination of reference ionosphere parameters:</b>
With the checkbox marked the stochastic ionosphere parameters referring to
the satellite observed nearest to the zenith are eliminated, i.e., you
estimate parameters which represent the ionospheric correction on the
double-difference level. To estimate the ionosphere parameters on a
quasi-single-difference level disable the option.

<p><i>Default value:</i> unmarked

<a name="DIONCON" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Elevation-dependent parameter constraining:</b>
An elevation-dependent parameter constraining is recommended when
processing low-elevation data. In this case the stochastic ionosphere
parameters are not set up as line-of-sight quantities but are referred
to the zenith.
<p><i>Default value:</i> marked

<a name="DIONSIG" default="0.25"></a>
<p><b>Absolute a priori sigma on single difference level:</b>
In the ambiguity-unresolved case you have to specify absolute a priori
weights as opposed to the ambiguity-resolved case where you may go
without (by entering <tt>0.00</tt>). In case of processing data taken in a
rapid static mode, a sigma of few centimeters is recommended.
<p><i>Default value:</i> <tt>0.25</tt>&nbsp;m

<a name="DIONSIGR" default="0.00"></a>
<p><b>Relative a priori sigma of ionospheric random walk:</b>
You may specify relative a priori constraints between consecutive
stochastic ionosphere parameters of the same satellite to model the
correlation of the ionospheric signal in time. This option may be used
only if you do not eliminate reference ionosphere parameters.

<p><b>GPSEST 6.11: Differential Code Biases</b>

<a name="DCBTYP" default="P1-P2"></a>
<p><b>PARAMETER SETUP</b>
<p><b>Type of differential code biases:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>P1-P2</b>:
  This type of code bias has to be considered when processing L4 for
  ionospheric purposes.
<li><b>P1-C1</b>:
  This type of code bias may become significant when processing L3
  using data collected under AS conditions. If you do not have a
  mixture of cross-correlation style receivers (providing C1 and
  something like C2=C1+(P2-P1)) and modern receivers (providing P1
  and P2), this type of code bias may be ignored. The estimation of
  receiver-specific (P1-C1) code biases might make sense if AS is
  turned off for some satellites.
<li><b>LC</b>:
  This type of bias is useful for time transfer applications
  relying on the ionosphere-free LC, specifically to handle
  receiver bias discontinuities.
<li><b>P1-C1_MULTIPLIER</b>:
  In order to detect the real code observation types provided by a
  specific receiver, multipliers with respect to a set of satellite
  P1-C1 a priori values can be determined. A PPP analysis on the basis
  of the ionosphere-free LC has to be done for this purpose.
  A resulting multiplier close to 0.00 suggests real P1/P2 code
  observations, one close to 1.00 indicates C1/C2 observations, and
  from a multiplier reaching 2.55, you may infer C1/P2 observations.

In order to estimate antenna offsets with GNSS data you have to select
one antenna as reference because only the estimation of relative phase
center offset differences between antennas is possible. You also have
to fix the site coordinates of all the points to accurately known values
(e.g. from terrestrial measurements). If you are processing GNSS data,
where you swapped or rotated antennas between sessions, you might estimate
horizontal site coordinates and antenna phase center offsets together. In
this case specify a file in the field "Receiver antenna orientation" in
panel "GPSEST 1.2: Input Files 2".

<p>In this and the following panels you may specify the options for
estimating receiver antenna phase center variations in elevation and
azimuth, either as grid or as spherical harmonics coefficients.
<br>
The mean receiver antenna offsets and the phase center variations with

that have to be used together.
<br>
Mean receiver antenna offsets and phase center patterns may not be
estimated together in one run. First, mean phase center offsets should be
computed and these offsets should then be used to estimate phase center
variations (patterns) based on these offsets.

<li><b>HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL</b> specifically for the horizontal and vertical

</ul>

<p><i>It is recommended</i>
to strongly constrain the scaling factors in GPSEST
because only a short interval of one single session (likely day) is covered,
where it is not expected to have big variations of one of these effects. The
parameters can only reliably be estimated from long time series of solutions on

<p><b>GPSEST 99.2: Local Troposphere Parameters</b>
<p>
The local troposphere model is recommended to use only in local campaigns
(distances between stations of several kilometers at most) with big height
differences. A polynomial model depending on the station height is estimated.
It gives the difference between the tropospheric influence on the data and
the a priori troposphere model.


<a name="LTRPMOD" default="24 00 00"></a>
<p><b>MODEL SPECIFICATION</b>
<p><b>Parameter interval:</b>
The time interval per model has to specify in this input field. If more
than one model is setup per observation interval each of these models
is estimated independently. The start and end times of the models are
computed using the general setting in "TIME OFFSET FOR PARAMETER INTERVALS".

<a name="LTRPPAR" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Polynomial degree:</b>
The polynomial degree for the local troposphere model.

<a name="LTRPSIG1" default=""></a>
<p><b>A priori sigma for zero-order term:</b>
An a priori sigma for the coefficients of the polynomial model may be
specified. A special sigma for the absolute term may be given; for local
networks it is recommended to constrain the zero-degree term to zero (since
the estimation of an absolute tropospheric correction is not possible in
this case).

<p><b>Maximum order of development:</b>
Specify the maximum order for which spherical harmonics of the Earth gravity
field are set up.
The parameter set up starts with order 0.

<p><a name="POTSIG" default=""></a>
<b>A priori sigma:</b>
This a priori sigma is applied to constrain the spherical harmonics
of the Earth gravity field.
<tt>0.0</tt> or blank is equivalent to no constraint.

<p><b>GPSEST 99.7: Satellite-Specific a Priori Sigmas</b>
<a name="SVNSIG" default="%% %% %% %% %% %%"></a>
<p>
Here you may specify satellite-specific a priori sigmas for the zero
difference phase observable. If you, e.g., set the a priori sigma to
0.02&nbsp;meters for satellite 16, the observations of this satellite will
have a weight 100 times smaller than the other observations assuming that
you set the general observation sigma (option "A priori sigma" in panel
"GPSEST 3.1: General Options 1") to 0.002&nbsp;meters. In addition a time
window for the validity of the satellite specific weights has to be
specified.
<br>
The accuracy codes given in the precise orbit file could be used to
assign a reasonable a priori sigma to each satellite.

<p><b>GPSEST 99.8: Time Window for GLONASS Receiver Clock Biases</b>

<a name="RCOSTR" default="%% %% %% %%"></a>
<p><b>TIME DEPENDENT INTER-SYSTEM BIASES</b>
<p>
A time-dependent inter-system bias between GPS and GLONASS can be introduced
by a piece-wise linear function. In the following input fields you may
define for which receiver type/number such parameters will be estimated:
<ul>
  <li><b>Receiver name</b> as it is given in the header of the observation file,
  <li><b>Receiver number</b> the (integer) number of the receiver from the
      header of the observation file, which can also be defined as a range to
      handle several receivers of the same type in a common way, and
  <li><b>Interval</b> between two parameters in a piece-wise linear
      representation. Note, that the parameter setup considers the
     "TIME OFFSET FOR PARAMETER INTERVALS" given in panel "GPSEST 5.2: Setup of Parameters and Pre-Elimination 2".
